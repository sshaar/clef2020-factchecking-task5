13	Donald Trump	This has been a spectacular year for you.	0
14	Donald Trump	I have heard all about your achievements.	0
15	Donald Trump	And a very special recognition for the midshipmen fourth class, you are plebs no more.	0
16	Donald Trump	To all of the distinguished faculty and staff, to the local sponsor families, and most importantly, to the parents and grandparents and family members who have helped our graduates reached this joyous hour, today is your incredible achievement also.	0
17	Donald Trump	They would have never made it without you, know this.	0
18	Donald Trump	I want to thank the midshipmen and your families, and thank you.	0
19	Donald Trump	America thanks you more than anybody.	0
20	Donald Trump	You have done a spectacular job.	0
21	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
22	Donald Trump	Finally, to the men and women about to be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy and second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, let me say on behalf of the entire nation, we could not be more proud of the United States Naval Academy Class of 2018.	0
23	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
24	Donald Trump	Great job.	0
25	Donald Trump	Congratulations to you all.	0
26	Donald Trump	Four years ago, each of you made the most important decision of your lives.	0
27	Donald Trump	You chose the path of hard work, sweat, and sacrifice.	0
28	Donald Trump	You chose the life of honor, courage, and commitment.	0
29	Donald Trump	You chose to serve the nation and defend our great American flag.	0
30	Donald Trump	You chose the Navy, blue and gold, from the first moments of induction day.	0
31	Donald Trump	Through a grueling six weeks of pleb summer, you endured and you persevered.	0
32	Donald Trump	And then the rest of the brigade returned, and the real test began.	0
33	Donald Trump	You developed morally, mentally, and physically.	0
34	Donald Trump	You poured yourselves into military tactics, seamanship, navigation, ethics, and engineering.	0
35	Donald Trump	And when hard work was not enough, like generations before you, you gathered your pennies and sought favor from the all-powerful Tecumseh.	0
36	Donald Trump	All-powerful.	0
37	Donald Trump	A little bit different.	0
38	Donald Trump	Others worked hard for their demerits at McGarvey's and the Fleet Reserve Club.	0
39	Donald Trump	And so today in keeping with tradition, I declare that all midshipmen on restriction for minor offenses, you are hereby absolved.	0
40	Donald Trump	That sounds like a lot of people.	0
41	Donald Trump	The Admiral will define exactly what that means, so Admiral, please go easy.	0
42	Donald Trump	This is a great group of people here, Admiral.	0
43	Donald Trump	I am told this class led Navy athletics to the highest win percentage in your 172-year history.	0
44	Donald Trump	Think about that.	0
45	Donald Trump	That includes taking the Army–Navy Star Series for the fourth straight year, a remarkable achievement in sport and athletics.	0
46	Donald Trump	And because you care about every contest against Army, for the record, this year, Navy beat Army 19 times.	0
47	Donald Trump	And I will not mention, I promised, who won the football game.	0
48	Donald Trump	I will not mention it.	0
49	Donald Trump	I refuse to say it.	0
50	Donald Trump	But that is a great achievement.	0
51	Donald Trump	And let me take a guess, you are still not tired of winning.	0
52	Donald Trump	Winning is such a great feeling, isn't it?	0
53	Donald Trump	Winning is such a great feeling.	0
54	Donald Trump	Nothing like winning, you got to win.	0
55	Donald Trump	In every endeavor, the class of 2018 has shown its metal and it's proved its might.	0
56	Donald Trump	You have earned your place in the ancient league of sailors and shipmates, captains and commanders, warriors and mariners, and Marines.	0
57	Donald Trump	You crave adventure.	0
58	Donald Trump	Hello, folks, back there.	0
59	Donald Trump	You chase discovery, and you never flinch in the eye of a raging storm.	0
60	Donald Trump	America is in your heart.	0
61	Donald Trump	The ocean is in your soul.	0
62	Donald Trump	The saltwater runs through your veins.	0
63	Donald Trump	You live your life according to the final law of the Navy.	0
64	Donald Trump	The word impossible does not exist, because Navy never quits.	0
65	Donald Trump	You don't give up.	0
66	Donald Trump	You don't give in.	0
67	Donald Trump	You don't back down.	0
68	Donald Trump	And you never surrender.	0
69	Donald Trump	Wherever you go, wherever you serve, wherever your mission takes you, you only have one word in mind, and that's victory.	0
70	Donald Trump	That is why you are here.	0
71	Donald Trump	Victory.	0
72	Donald Trump	A very important word.	0
73	Donald Trump	You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet.	0
74	Donald Trump	The United States military.	0
75	Donald Trump	And we are respected again, I can tell you that.	0
76	Donald Trump	We are respected again.	0
77	Donald Trump	A lot of things have happened.	0
78	Donald Trump	We are respected again.	0
79	Donald Trump	For the last four years, you have walked the same paths as Navy's greatest legends, the giants of Midway and Coral Sea and Manila Bay.	0
80	Donald Trump	Here in Annapolis, the glorious past is all around you, and so are the stories of your great heroes.	0
81	Donald Trump	One such hero who appears in the pages of your old yearbooks is Bruce Voorhees.	0
82	Donald Trump	Well-known all over.	0
83	Donald Trump	Bruce hailed from Nevada and was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1929.	0
84	Donald Trump	Beneath his picture in the 1929 Lucky Bag, Bruce's classmates wrote that he spent most of his time teaching the city slickers from the east the correct pronunciation of Nevada.	0
85	Donald Trump	And I had to learn that, too, to win the state.	0
86	Donald Trump	Great place.	0
87	Donald Trump	He saw studying as an unnecessary evil, and they remembered in three cruises and four years in blue-serge brass buttons, he left a trail of broken hearts extending the full length of both coasts and radiating for miles around.	0
88	Donald Trump	Crabtown.	0
89	Donald Trump	In other words, he was just like you in many ways.	0
90	Donald Trump	Just like you.	0
91	Donald Trump	Not a lot of difference.	0
92	Donald Trump	Just over a decade after his graduation, Lieutenant Commander Voorhees found himself at war.	0
93	Donald Trump	Seventy-five years ago this summer, he was in the South Pacific commanding Bombing Squadron 102 during the battle of the Solomon Islands.	0
94	Donald Trump	That was a rough battle.	0
95	Donald Trump	His only brother had been killed and the Bataan Death March.	0
96	Donald Trump	On July 6, Bruce volunteered for a mission to destroy a crucial enemy base.	0
97	Donald Trump	It was a rough time.	0
98	Donald Trump	It was a rough, tough situation.	0
99	Donald Trump	He knew full-well that he would likely never return.	0
100	Donald Trump	He knew he was going to die.	0
101	Donald Trump	But he also knew his daring action could prevent a surprise attack on large-scale American forces.	0
102	Donald Trump	So, his plane took off alone on a 700-mile flight.	0
103	Donald Trump	Bruce flew through the darkness to his target, a tiny speck on the vast open sea.	0
104	Donald Trump	He braved unrelenting anti-aircraft fire, like nobody had ever seen at that time, and a trail of enemy planes to single-handedly destroy this large enemy base, including multiple fortifications, and a critical communications link.	0
105	Donald Trump	And in this final act of valor, Bruce was caught in the blast of one of his own bombs and perished in a remote lagoon very far from here.	0
106	Donald Trump	His life was lost, but his legacy will live forever.	0
107	Donald Trump	Many of you have seen his old room at Bancroft Hall, commemorating his Congressional Medal of Honor, our highest honor.	0
108	Donald Trump	Some here today will trace his path to Pensacola to earn your wings.	0
109	Donald Trump	You may even make it all the way out to the legendary combat-training school known as Top Gun in bruce's beloved hometown in Nevada.	0
110	Donald Trump	There, you will have the honor to take flight from the Voorhees Field, and remember a hero who fought for his country, and died for his homeland, and saved so many lives with his bravery.	0
111	Donald Trump	Each of you inherits the legacy of the heroes who came before you.	0
112	Donald Trump	It's a living history passed down from officer to officer and generation to generation.	0
113	Donald Trump	Each of you will make your own mark on the Navy, the Marine Corps, the military, and the history of our great nation.	0
114	Donald Trump	Seize today and you will shape tomorrow.	0
115	Donald Trump	In a few moments, you will be commissioned into the mightiest fighting forces of the air, the land, and the sea.	0
116	Donald Trump	Together, you will blast off carriers of which we are just now finishing, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and launch off submarines of which we have many under construction, and ward off evil.	0
117	Donald Trump	You will bring comfort to our friends and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.	0
118	Donald Trump	Among our graduates today will be 283 naval aviators, 134 submariners, 256 surface-warfare officers, 70 restricted-line officers, and 15 explosive-ordnance-disposal officers.	0
119	Donald Trump	Two-hundred-and-thirty-six United States Marines, and 35 very tough, very well conditioned Navy SEALs.	0
120	Donald Trump	Together, you are the tip of the spear, the edge of the blade, and the front of the shield defending and protecting our great country.	0
121	Donald Trump	You know, there is no mission our pilots can't handle.	0
122	Donald Trump	There is no hill our Marines can't take, and there is no stronghold the SEALs can't reach.	0
123	Donald Trump	There is no sea the Navy can't brave, and there is no storm the American sailor can't conquer.	0
124	Donald Trump	Because you know that together, there is nothing Americans can't do.	0
125	Donald Trump	Absolutely nothing.	0
126	Donald Trump	In recent years and even decades, too many people have forgotten that truth.	0
127	Donald Trump	They have forgotten that our ancestors trounced an empire, tamed a continent, and triumphed over the worst evils in history.	0
128	Donald Trump	In every generation, there have been cynics and critics that try to tear down America.	0
129	Donald Trump	But in recent years, the problem grew worse.	0
130	Donald Trump	A growing number used their platforms to denigrate America's incredible heritage, challenge America's sovereignty, and weaken America's pride.	0
131	Donald Trump	We know the truth, will speak the truth, and defend that truth.	0
132	Donald Trump	America is the greatest fighting force for peace, justice, and freedom in the history of the world.	0
133	Donald Trump	And in case you have not noticed, we have become a lot stronger lately.	0
134	Donald Trump	A lot.	0
135	Donald Trump	We are not going to apologize for America.	0
136	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for America.	0
137	Donald Trump	No more apologies.	0
138	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for our citizens.	0
139	Donald Trump	We are going to stand up for our values.	0
140	Donald Trump	And we are going to stand up for our men and women in uniform.	0
141	Donald Trump	Because we know that a nation must have pride in its history to have confidence in its future.	0
142	Donald Trump	We are the nation that built the highways, the railroads, the Empire State Building in one year, the Golden Gate Bridge, and we are the nation that built the Panama Canal.	0
143	Donald Trump	We trekked the mountains, explored the oceans, and settled the vast frontier.	0
144	Donald Trump	We won two world wars, defeated communism and fascism, and put a man on the face of the moon.	0
145	Donald Trump	We cured disease, pioneered science, and produced timeless works of art that inspire the human soul.	0
146	Donald Trump	And on distant islands, far-away battlefields, above the skies and beneath the sea, the entire world has borne witness to the unstoppable strength, skill, and courage of the United States Navy and the American Marines.	0
147	Donald Trump	Each of you enters service at a truly exciting time for our country.	0
148	Donald Trump	For we are witnessing the great reawakening of the American spirit and of American might.	0
149	Donald Trump	We have rediscovered our identity, regained our stride, and we are proud again.	0
150	Donald Trump	Prosperity is booming at home.	0
151	Donald Trump	Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.	0
152	Donald Trump	And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago abroad.	0
153	Donald Trump	Yes, they are respecting us again.	0
154	Donald Trump	Yes, America is back.	0
155	Donald Trump	We have begun the great rebuilding of the United States military.	0
156	Donald Trump	We have ended the disastrous defense sequester.	0
157	Donald Trump	No money for the military?	0
158	Donald Trump	Those days are over.	0
159	Donald Trump	And we have just secured, you have read all about it, a $700 billion, largest-ever amount of money to support our great war fighters.	0
160	Donald Trump	And I might add that next year—the $700 billion, not million.	0
161	Donald Trump	They're liking the sound of million, but billion is better—the $700 billion goes to $716 billion, and we are going to be stronger than ever before.	0
162	Donald Trump	We will have the strongest military that we have ever had, and it won't even be close.	0
163	Donald Trump	And when did we need it more than now?	0
164	Donald Trump	That means new ships.	0
165	Donald Trump	You like that.	0
166	Donald Trump	We have now the lowest number of ships we have had since World War I.	0
167	Donald Trump	And very soon, we are going to get to 355 beautiful ships.	0
168	Donald Trump	That is almost a couple of hundred more ships.	0
169	Donald Trump	So you will be around for a long time.	0
170	Donald Trump	We are not running out of equipment.	0
171	Donald Trump	We're not running out of ships.	0
172	Donald Trump	And that has been approved.	0
173	Donald Trump	And we are honored by it.	0
174	Donald Trump	You are going to have new equipment, and well-deserved pay raises.	0
175	Donald Trump	We just got to a big pay raise for the first time in 10 years.	0
176	Donald Trump	We got to a big pay increase, first time in over 10 years.	1
177	Donald Trump	I fought for you.	0
178	Donald Trump	That was the hardest one to get.	0
179	Donald Trump	But you never had a chance of losing.	0
180	Donald Trump	I represented you well.	0
181	Donald Trump	I represented you well.	0
182	Donald Trump	And this week, we passed new landmark legislation to give more choice and better care to our great veterans.	0
183	Donald Trump	We are going to take care of our veterans.	0
184	Donald Trump	We are doing a great job with it.	0
185	Donald Trump	We are taking care, finally, after decades, we are taking care of our veterans.	0
186	Donald Trump	We passed VA accountability.	0
187	Donald Trump	Everybody said it could not be done.	0
188	Donald Trump	If you didn't do a good job, you could not get fired.	0
189	Donald Trump	Now, you don't do a good job and take care of our veterans, they will look you in the eye and they say, "Jim	0
190	Donald Trump	We will say, "Get him out of here	0
191	Donald Trump	We are reestablishing the second fleet in the Atlantic: bigger, better, stronger than it has ever been before.	0
192	Donald Trump	We are rebuilding our defense industrial base to forge American iron, aluminum, and steel, which, by the way, we just put tariffs on when it comes in from other countries.	0
193	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
194	Donald Trump	We are taking in a lot of money now, our country.	0
195	Donald Trump	They pay that big, beautiful tariff and it goes right into building new ships.	0
196	Donald Trump	We have been taken advantage of by the world.	0
197	Donald Trump	That is not going to be happening anymore.	0
198	Donald Trump	You see what is going on.	0
199	Donald Trump	So, we are building a modern fleet manned by the greatest sailors.	0
200	Donald Trump	We're sharpening the fighting edge from Marines infantry squads to combat ships to deliver maximum, lethal force.	0
201	Donald Trump	The enemy has to know we have that.	0
202	Donald Trump	We are recommitting to this fundamental truth: We are a maritime nation.	0
203	Donald Trump	Being a maritime nation, we are surrounded by sea.	0
204	Donald Trump	We must always dominate that sea.	0
205	Donald Trump	We will always dominate the oceans.	0
206	Donald Trump	We are showing what we can achieve when natural American confidence is backed by unrivaled American power and unquestioned American resolve.	0
207	Donald Trump	Also, there is another word that's never used, and I will use it today.	0
208	Donald Trump	It's called talent.	0
209	Donald Trump	We have talent and a lot of other people don't, and a lot of other countries don't.	0
210	Donald Trump	We have great talent and I have seen it.	0
211	Donald Trump	In other words, we are showing what is possible when America starts acting like its sailors and Marines.	0
212	Donald Trump	Our nation cannot be strong without the heroes whose hearts stir the words: Don't give up the ship.	0
213	Donald Trump	Famous phrase.	0
214	Donald Trump	We even use it in business.	0
215	Donald Trump	Things are going bad, you say, "Don't give up the ship.""	0
216	Donald Trump	Keep fighting.	0
217	Donald Trump	Don't give up the ship.	0
218	Donald Trump	But it's really—you guys started it.	0
219	Donald Trump	Our country cannot prevail without those who rally to the famous cry	0
220	Donald Trump	You hail from every background and you come from every walk of life.	0
221	Donald Trump	But each of you is formed by the same defining choice, to answer the call.	0
222	Donald Trump	You all share the same heart, the same blood, and swear by the same motto: Not for self but country.	0
223	Donald Trump	It's a great motto.	0
224	Donald Trump	With us today are living symbols of that long and unbroken chain of American patriots, members of the Naval Academy class of 1968.	0
225	Donald Trump	That's great.	0
226	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.	0
227	Donald Trump	Exactly 50 years ago, they were in your shoes.	0
228	Donald Trump	They embarked into service and they made America very proud.	0
229	Donald Trump	To everyone in the class of 1968, we thank you and we salute you.	0
230	Donald Trump	Like those who came before them, today's graduates will serve America through times of triumph and some hours of peril.	0
231	Donald Trump	There will be hours of peril.	0
232	Donald Trump	You will face new challenges, even challenges that you can't envision, but you'll find new solutions that nobody can even imagine.	0
233	Donald Trump	Among your ranks is the next Chester Nimitz, the next Grace Hopper, the next John Lejeune.	0
234	Donald Trump	Future generations will talk about you.	0
235	Donald Trump	They will tell your stories, speak of your courage, and someone many years from now will be standing right here, in my position, paying tribute to your great service.	0
236	Donald Trump	It will happen.	0
237	Donald Trump	Because you already know the keys to success.	0
238	Donald Trump	You know that as long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, we will not fail.	0
239	Donald Trump	We will not fail.	0
240	Donald Trump	We cannot fail.	0
241	Donald Trump	We will always succeed, always.	0
242	Donald Trump	As long as we are united with the same mission, the same purpose, the same patriotic heart, we will win, because we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.	0
243	Donald Trump	Together we struggle.	0
244	Donald Trump	Together we strive.	0
245	Donald Trump	Together we pray.	0
246	Donald Trump	And together we triumph as citizens, as patriots, as Americans.	0
247	Donald Trump	We stand on the shoulders of heroes who gave their sweat, their blood, their tears, and their very lives for this great country of ours.	0
248	Donald Trump	This is our heritage.	0
249	Donald Trump	This is our home.	0
250	Donald Trump	And this is our pledge.	0
251	Donald Trump	We are all in for America, like never before.	0
252	Donald Trump	We are all in for our great country.	0
253	Donald Trump	So to the Naval Academy of the class of 2018, I say a number of things.	0
254	Donald Trump	Number one, I say that I was given an option.	0
255	Donald Trump	I could make this commencement address, which is a great honor for me, and immediately leave and wave goodbye, or I could stay and shake hands with just the top 100, or I could stay for hours and shake hands with 1,100 and something.	0
256	Donald Trump	What should I do?	0
257	Donald Trump	What should I do?	0
258	Donald Trump	I'll stay.	0
259	Donald Trump	I'll stay.	0
260	Donald Trump	I will stay.	0
261	Donald Trump	But to the class of 2018, I do say strive for excellence.	0
262	Donald Trump	Live for adventure.	0
263	Donald Trump	Think big.	0
264	Donald Trump	Dream bigger.	0
265	Donald Trump	Push further.	0
266	Donald Trump	Sail faster.	0
267	Donald Trump	Fly higher.	0
268	Donald Trump	And never, ever stop reaching for greatness.	0
269	Donald Trump	Never stop reaching for the stars.	0
270	Donald Trump	You know you're up to the task.	0
271	Donald Trump	You're among the finest people anywhere in the world, the smartest, the strongest.	0
272	Donald Trump	You know you will make us proud.	0
273	Donald Trump	We know that glory will be yours because you are winners.	0
274	Donald Trump	You are warriors.	0
275	Donald Trump	You are fighters.	0
276	Donald Trump	You are champions, and you will lead us only to victory.	0
277	Donald Trump	Good luck.	0
278	Donald Trump	May god be with you.	0
279	Donald Trump	God bless America, and anchors away.	0
