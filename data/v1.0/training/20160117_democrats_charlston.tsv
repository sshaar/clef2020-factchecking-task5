2	HOLT	After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.	0
3	HOLT	And New Hampshire not far behind.	0
4	HOLT	Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins.	0
5	HOLT	Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates.	0
6	HOLT	So let's get started.	0
7	HOLT	Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley.	0
8	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
9	HOLT	Well, welcome to all of you.	0
10	HOLT	Hope you're excited, we're excited.	0
11	HOLT	We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.	0
12	HOLT	I'm joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight.	0
13	HOLT	The rules are simple.	0
14	HOLT	Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals.	0
15	HOLT	I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight.	0
16	HOLT	We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.	0
17	HOLT	This is a critical point in the race.	0
18	HOLT	You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail.	0
19	HOLT	We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight.	0
20	HOLT	Let's have a great debate.	0
21	HOLT	We'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.	0
22	CLINTON	Well, good evening.	0
23	CLINTON	And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.	0
24	CLINTON	You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King.	0
25	CLINTON	I was a teenager.	0
26	CLINTON	And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service.	0
27	CLINTON	I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.	0
28	CLINTON	And that is our fight still.	0
29	CLINTON	We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind.	0
30	CLINTON	We have to keep our communities and our country safe.	0
31	CLINTON	We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.	0
32	CLINTON	I understand that this is the hardest job in the world.	0
33	CLINTON	I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.	0
34	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
35	HOLT	Thank you.	0
36	HOLT	Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.	0
37	SANDERS	Thank you.	0
38	SANDERS	As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country.	0
39	SANDERS	As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.	0
40	SANDERS	And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.	0
41	SANDERS	This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.	0
42	HOLT	Senator, thank you.	0
43	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
44	HOLT	And Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.	0
45	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
46	O'MALLEY	My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his "I Have A Dream" speech.	0
47	O'MALLEY	And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.	0
48	O'MALLEY	You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.	0
49	O'MALLEY	Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression.	0
50	O'MALLEY	And that's what he's done.	0
51	O'MALLEY	Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.	0
52	O'MALLEY	But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.	0
53	O'MALLEY	We need new leadership.	0
54	O'MALLEY	We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.	0
55	O'MALLEY	That's why I'm running for president.	0
56	O'MALLEY	I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.	0
57	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
58	HOLT	All right.	0
59	HOLT	And Governor, thank you.	0
60	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
61	HOLT	All right, to our first question, now.	0
62	HOLT	The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.	0
63	HOLT	President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform.	0
64	HOLT	Voters want to know how you would define your presidency?	0
65	HOLT	How would you think big?	0
66	HOLT	So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be — fill in the blank.	0
67	HOLT	Senator Sanders.	0
68	SANDERS	Well, that's what our campaign is about.	0
69	SANDERS	It is thinking big.	0
70	SANDERS	It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.	0
71	SANDERS	So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.	0
72	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
73	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.	0
74	CLINTON	I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
75	CLINTON	I would also...	0
76	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
77	CLINTON	...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.	0
78	CLINTON	And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together.	0
79	CLINTON	We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness.	0
80	CLINTON	There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together.	0
81	CLINTON	That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.	0
82	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
83	HOLT	Governor O'Malley, same question.	0
84	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
85	O'MALLEY	First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down.	0
86	O'MALLEY	Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.	0
87	O'MALLEY	Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change.	0
88	O'MALLEY	And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.	0
89	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
90	HOLT	Thank you.	0
91	HOLT	You've all...	0
92	O'MALLEY	Finally — I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.	0
93	O'MALLEY	And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities.	0
94	O'MALLEY	We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter.	0
95	O'MALLEY	We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.	0
96	HOLT	All right governor thank you.	0
97	HOLT	We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening.	0
98	HOLT	The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race.	0
99	HOLT	Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.	0
100	HOLT	Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, "a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby."	0
101	HOLT	Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?	0
102	SANDERS	Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous.	0
103	SANDERS	I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
104	SANDERS	I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.	0
105	SANDERS	I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns.	0
106	SANDERS	And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable.	0
107	SANDERS	I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.	0
108	SANDERS	We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people.	0
109	SANDERS	This should not be a political issue.	0
110	SANDERS	What we should be doing is working together.	0
111	SANDERS	And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...	0
112	HOLT	Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers.	0
113	HOLT	So can you...	0
114	SANDERS	What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on.	0
115	SANDERS	We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation.	0
116	SANDERS	And what we also said, "is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun."	0
117	SANDERS	So what I said is, " I would re-look at it."	0
118	SANDERS	We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.	0
119	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.	0
120	CLINTON	Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times.	0
121	CLINTON	He voted against the Brady Bill five times.	0
122	CLINTON	He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.	1
123	CLINTON	He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, "was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "	0
124	CLINTON	He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks.	0
125	CLINTON	He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.	0
126	CLINTON	Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country.	0
127	CLINTON	That's 33,000 people a year.	0
128	CLINTON	One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered.	0
129	CLINTON	Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation.	1
130	CLINTON	There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.	0
131	HOLT	All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns.	0
132	HOLT	This conversation might be worrying many of them.	0
133	HOLT	They may be hearing, "you want to take my guns.	0
134	HOLT	What would you say to them?	0
135	O'MALLEY	This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them.	0
136	O'MALLEY	They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.	0
137	O'MALLEY	I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation.	0
138	O'MALLEY	This is very personal to me being from Baltimore.	0
139	O'MALLEY	I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet.	0
140	O'MALLEY	And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.	0
141	O'MALLEY	He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.	0
142	O'MALLEY	And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him.	0
143	O'MALLEY	I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.	0
144	O'MALLEY	In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.	0
145	O'MALLEY	So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together.	0
146	O'MALLEY	We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation.	0
147	O'MALLEY	It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what?	0
148	O'MALLEY	We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.	0
149	O'MALLEY	I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer.	0
150	O'MALLEY	And, so...	0
151	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
152	O'MALLEY	...we're able to actually do these things.	0
153	HOLT	Alright, Governor, thank you.	0
154	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year.	0
155	HOLT	Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings.	0
156	HOLT	We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.	0
157	HOLT	We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap.	0
158	HOLT	Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?	0
159	CLINTON	Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers.	0
160	CLINTON	Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
161	CLINTON	And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.	0
162	CLINTON	One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison.	0
163	CLINTON	That's the statistic.	0
164	CLINTON	I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...	0
165	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
166	CLINTON	...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.	0
167	CLINTON	So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.	0
168	HOLT	You time is up.	0
169	HOLT	Senator Sanders, my next question is...	0
170	SANDERS	...Well, I — look...	0
171	HOLT	...	0
172	HOLT	It's actually — actually my next question is to you...	0
173	SANDERS	... Let me respond to what the secretary said.	0
174	SANDERS	We have a criminal justice system which is broken.	0
175	SANDERS	Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China?	0
176	SANDERS	Disproportionately African American, and Latino.	0
177	SANDERS	Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed?	0
178	SANDERS	Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.	0
179	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
180	HOLT	Senator Sanders...	0
181	SANDERS	... We need to take a very hard look at our...	0
182	HOLT	Senator.	0
183	HOLT	Senator Sanders...	0
184	SANDERS	... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .	0
185	HOLT	... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you.	0
186	HOLT	He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision.	0
187	HOLT	In fact, our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters.	0
188	HOLT	How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support?	0
189	SANDERS	Well, let me talk about polling.	0
190	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
191	SANDERS	As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me.	0
192	SANDERS	We were all of three percentage points.	0
193	SANDERS	Guess what?	0
194	SANDERS	In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close.	0
195	SANDERS	Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire.	0
196	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]	0
197	SANDERS	In terms of polling, guess what?	0
198	SANDERS	We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton.	0
199	SANDERS	In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.	0
200	SANDERS	To answer your question.	0
201	SANDERS	When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice — just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community.	0
202	SANDERS	We have the momentum, we're on a path to a victory.	0
203	SYSTEM	[ applause and cheering ]	0
204	O'MALLEY	Lester, I	0
205	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]	0
206	HOLT	Governor, I'm going to come to you in a second.	0
207	HOLT	Google searches for the words, "Black Lives Matter" surpassed, "civil rights movement".	0
208	HOLT	And, here in South Carolina, "black lives matter" was the number one trending political issue. Governor O'Malley, you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore.	0
209	HOLT	Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.	0
210	HOLT	And right from the start of your campaign, you've been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest.	0
211	HOLT	What responsibility do you bear?	0
212	O'MALLEY	Yes, let's talk about this.	0
213	O'MALLEY	When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well.	0
214	O'MALLEY	It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.	0
215	O'MALLEY	And that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter.	0
216	O'MALLEY	And we did a number of things.	0
217	O'MALLEY	We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.	0
218	O'MALLEY	But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations.	0
219	O'MALLEY	The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board.	0
220	O'MALLEY	And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.	0
221	O'MALLEY	We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives.	0
222	O'MALLEY	We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force.	0
223	O'MALLEY	I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.	0
224	O'MALLEY	I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.	0
225	O'MALLEY	I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...	0
226	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
227	HOLT	All right.	0
228	HOLT	Let's talk...	0
229	O'MALLEY	... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.	0
230	HOLT	Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system.	0
231	HOLT	Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos.	0
232	HOLT	Let's watch.	0
233	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]	0
234	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	Hey, I'm Franchesca Ramsey.	0
235	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.	0
236	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren't indicted.	0
237	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?	0
238	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]	0
239	HOLT	Senator Sanders.	0
240	SANDERS	I apologize for not hearing all of that question.	0
241	HOLT	Would you like me to read it back to you?	0
242	SANDERS	Yes.	0
243	HOLT	Prosecutors — "I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities.	0
244	HOLT	Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.	0
245	HOLT	How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?"	0
246	SANDERS	Absolutely.	0
247	SANDERS	This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved.	0
248	SANDERS	Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation.	0
249	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
250	SANDERS	Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.	0
251	SANDERS	If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.	0
252	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
253	SANDERS	And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies.	0
254	SANDERS	We've got to move toward community policing.	0
255	SANDERS	And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.	0
256	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
257	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this question is for you.	0
258	HOLT	Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike.	0
259	HOLT	It has become a major issue in this race.	0
260	HOLT	In a lot of places where you've been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed.	0
261	HOLT	So what would you do?	0
262	CLINTON	Well, Lester, you're right.	0
263	CLINTON	Everywhere I go to campaign, I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned.	0
264	CLINTON	And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.	0
265	CLINTON	So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.	0
266	CLINTON	The policing needs to change.	0
267	CLINTON	Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan.	0
268	CLINTON	They should be able to administer it.	0
269	CLINTON	So should firefighters and others.	0
270	CLINTON	We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue.	0
271	CLINTON	And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.	0
272	HOLT	And that's time.	0
273	CLINTON	So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...	0
274	HOLT	Senator...	0
275	CLINTON	... a growing epidemic.	0
276	HOLT	Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?	0
277	SANDERS	Sure.	0
278	SANDERS	I agree...	0

280	SANDERS	I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.	0
281	SANDERS	And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment.	0
282	SANDERS	People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...	0
283	HOLT	That's...	0
284	SANDERS	... healthcare with mental health...	0
285	HOLT	... time.	0
286	SANDERS	... a part of that.	0
287	HOLT	We're going to get into all that coming up.	0
288	O'MALLEY	Lester, just ten seconds.	0
289	HOLT	But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break...	0
290	O'MALLEY	Just 10 seconds.	0
291	O'MALLEY	All of the things...	0
292	HOLT	... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.	0
293	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]	0
294	HOLT	Welcome back to Charleston.	0
295	HOLT	Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement — that would be health care.	0
296	HOLT	Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.	0
297	HOLT	Let's turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.	0
298	MITCHELL	Thank you, Lester.	0
299	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls "Medicare for all."	0
300	MITCHELL	Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.	0
301	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?	0
302	CLINTON	Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care.	0
303	CLINTON	I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.	0
304	CLINTON	And I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter.	0
305	CLINTON	And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?	0
306	CLINTON	He didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either.	0
307	CLINTON	And tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan.	0
308	CLINTON	And again, we need to get into the details.	0
309	CLINTON	But here's what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.	0
310	CLINTON	We finally have a path to universal health care.	0
311	CLINTON	We have accomplished so much already.	0
312	CLINTON	I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate.	0
313	CLINTON	I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.	0
314	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
315	SANDERS	OK.	0
316	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders?	0
317	SANDERS	Secretary — Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question.	0
318	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
319	SANDERS	Because what her campaign was saying — Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children's health insurance program.	0
320	SANDERS	That is nonsense.	0
321	SANDERS	What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right.	0
322	SANDERS	Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in?	0
323	SANDERS	They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.	0
324	SANDERS	I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act.	0
325	SANDERS	I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation.	0
326	SANDERS	I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance.	0
327	SANDERS	We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.	0
328	SANDERS	And here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country.	0
329	SANDERS	My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.	0
330	SANDERS	That's the vision we need to take.	0
331	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
332	CLINTON	But — Senator Sanders, if I can...	0
333	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
334	CLINTON	You know, I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress.	0
335	CLINTON	But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act.	0
336	CLINTON	That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.	0
337	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
338	CLINTON	And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance.	0
339	CLINTON	We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.	0
340	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
341	CLINTON	We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men.	0
342	CLINTON	And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent's policy.	0
343	SANDERS	But — what if we have...	0
344	CLINTON	Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.	0
345	SANDERS	It is — it is absolutely inaccurate.	0
346	O'MALLEY	I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state.	0
347	MITCHELL	Governor — Governor Sanders...	0
348	SANDERS	No one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward.	0
349	SANDERS	But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.	0
350	SANDERS	Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people?	0
351	SANDERS	Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians.	0
352	SANDERS	The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.	0
353	SANDERS	We're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act.	0
354	SANDERS	I helped write it.	0
355	SANDERS	But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for-all system.	0
356	O'MALLEY	Andrea — Andrea — Andrea.	0
357	O'MALLEY	[	0
358	O'MALLEY	crosstalk ]	0
359	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
360	O'MALLEY	Instead of — Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.	0
361	O'MALLEY	In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system.	0
362	O'MALLEY	With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.	0
363	O'MALLEY	And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital.	0
364	O'MALLEY	How well they keep their patients.	0
365	O'MALLEY	That's the future.	0
366	O'MALLEY	We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.	0
367	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
368	CLINTON	And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act — what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.	0
369	CLINTON	But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back.	0
370	CLINTON	The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.	0
371	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
372	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...	0
373	SANDERS	Yeah.	0
374	MITCHELL	... you've talked about Medicare for all...	0
375	SANDERS	Yes.	0
376	MITCHELL	.. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan, just two...	0
377	SANDERS	Not all that detailed.	0
378	MITCHELL	... well, two hours before the debate, you did.	0
379	SANDERS	Well.	0
380	MITCHELL	But let me ask you about Vermont.	0
381	MITCHELL	Because in Vermont — you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of — of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...	0
382	SANDERS	Well, that's — you might want to ask...	0
383	MITCHELL	... and by some estimates, it would double the budget.	0
384	MITCHELL	If you couldn't sell it in Vermont, Senator...	0
385	SANDERS	Andrea, let me just say this.	0
386	MITCHELL	... how can you sell it to the country?	0
387	SANDERS	Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it.	0
388	SANDERS	I'm not the governor.	0
389	SANDERS	I'm the senator from the state of Vermont.	0
390	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
391	SANDERS	But second of all — second of all...	0
392	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
393	SANDERS	... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you've raised — the good questions you've raised.	0
394	SANDERS	You know what it all comes down to?	0
395	SANDERS	Do you know why we can't do what every other country — major country on Earth is doing?	0
396	SANDERS	It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.	0
397	SANDERS	What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward — it's Medicare for all — it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.	0
398	SANDERS	That's what this debate should be about.	0
399	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
400	CLINTON	Well, as someone who — as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...	0
401	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
402	CLINTON	...many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.	0
403	CLINTON	I know how much money influences the political decision-making.	0
404	CLINTON	That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform.	0
405	CLINTON	However, we started a system that had private health insurance.	0
406	CLINTON	And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option.	0
407	CLINTON	In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that.	0
408	CLINTON	So, what I'm saying is really simple.	0
409	CLINTON	This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades.	0
410	CLINTON	We have the Affordable Care Act.	0
411	CLINTON	Let's make it work.	0
412	CLINTON	Let's take the models that states are doing.	0
413	CLINTON	We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.	1
414	CLINTON	Now we've got to get individual costs down.	1
415	CLINTON	That's what I'm planning to do.	0
416	HOLT	And that's time.	0
417	HOLT	We're gonna take a turn now.	0
418	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together.	0
419	HOLT	If President Obama couldn't do it, how will you?	0
420	O'MALLEY	Great question.	0
421	CLINTON	Well, I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union.	0
422	CLINTON	And here's what I would say.	0
423	CLINTON	I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.	0
424	CLINTON	That's what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.	0
425	CLINTON	What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.	0
426	CLINTON	And it's what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.	0
427	CLINTON	So I know it's hard, but I also know you've got to work at it every single day.	0
428	CLINTON	I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress.	0
429	CLINTON	And I know that they work at it every single day.	0
430	CLINTON	Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows.	0
431	CLINTON	If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more.	0
432	CLINTON	That's what I would do.	0
433	HOLT	That's time.	0
434	HOLT	Senator Sanders, response.	0
435	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
436	SANDERS	A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history.	0
437	SANDERS	But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you're expression.	0
438	SANDERS	In all do respect, you're missing the main point.	0
439	SANDERS	And the main point in the Congress, it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.	0
440	SANDERS	That's a mythology from the media.	0
441	SANDERS	The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.	0
442	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
443	SANDERS	The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour.	0
444	SANDERS	The American people want it.	0
445	SANDERS	Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it.	0
446	SANDERS	The pay equity for women, the American people want it.	0
447	SANDERS	Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes.	0
448	SANDERS	The American people want it.	0
449	HOLT	That's time.	0
450	HOLT	But let me continue with the...	0
451	SANDERS	The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.	0
452	HOLT	Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...	0
453	SANDERS	I do.	0
454	HOLT	And throughout your career in politics, you've been critical of the Democratic party, you've been saying in a book you wrote, quote, "There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties."	0
455	HOLT	How would you will a general election...	0
456	SANDERS	Did I say that?	0
457	HOLT	How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?	0
458	SANDERS	Because of what I believe in what I was just saying.	0
459	SANDERS	The Democratic party needs major reform.	0
460	SANDERS	To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.	0
461	SANDERS	Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors.	0
462	SANDERS	We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people.	0
463	SANDERS	Not wealthy campaign contributors.	0
464	HOLT	Yes, but senator, you can...	0
465	SANDERS	We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party.	0
466	SANDERS	I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people.	0
467	SANDERS	We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.	0
468	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
469	O'MALLEY	Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.	0
470	O'MALLEY	In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.	0
471	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
472	O'MALLEY	We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it's no laughing matter.	0
473	O'MALLEY	The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country?	0
474	O'MALLEY	This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.	0
475	O'MALLEY	All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that's what we need now in a new leader.	0
476	O'MALLEY	We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it's all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.	0
477	O'MALLEY	Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed.	0
478	HOLT	And that is right.	0
479	SANDERS	And I respectfully disagree.	0
480	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you.	0
481	HOLT	Here's another quantitative problem.	0
482	SANDERS	And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here.	0
483	SANDERS	And that is, you are right.	0
484	SANDERS	All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.	0
485	SANDERS	But where I disagree with you, Governor O'Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...	0
486	O'MALLEY	I agree with that.	0
487	SANDERS	... who control economic and political life of this country.	0
488	O'MALLEY	I agree.	0
489	SANDERS	Nothing real will get happened.	0
490	SANDERS	Unless we have a political revolution.	0
491	SANDERS	Where millions of people finally stand up.	0
492	HOLT	And we're going to get into that coming up.	0
493	HOLT	But Secretary Clinton, here's a question from YouTube.	0
494	HOLT	It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers.	0
495	HOLT	He has a question about the importance of younger voters.	0
496	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]	0
497	FRANTA	Hi, I'm Connor Franta, I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age.	0
498	FRANTA	Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.	0
499	FRANTA	Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?	0
500	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]	0
501	HOLT	Secretary Clinton.	0
502	CLINTON	Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that's quite an accomplishment.	0
503	CLINTON	Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.	0
504	CLINTON	I've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing.	0
505	CLINTON	So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.	0
506	CLINTON	And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights.	0
507	CLINTON	So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me...	0
508	HOLT	That's time...	0
509	CLINTON	That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.	0
510	HOLT	A quick follow up — a thirty second follow up.	0
511	HOLT	Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?	0
512	CLINTON	Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.	0
513	HOLT	We're going to take...	0
514	SANDERS	Is that your strategy...	0
515	HOLT	We're going to take a break.	0
516	HOLT	When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy.	0
517	HOLT	We'll be right back.	0
518	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]	0
519	HOLT	Welcome back from Charleston.	0
520	HOLT	Let's turn now to the economy.	0
521	HOLT	Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street.	0
522	HOLT	One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do.	0
523	HOLT	My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.	0
524	HOLT	What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?	0
525	SANDERS	Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks.	0
526	SANDERS	I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.	0
527	SANDERS	What I would do...	0
528	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
529	SANDERS	What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.	0
530	SANDERS	You've got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions.	0
531	SANDERS	They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy.	0
532	SANDERS	If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful.	0
533	SANDERS	Break them up.	0
534	SANDERS	I believe that's what the American people to want see.	0
535	SANDERS	That's my view.	0
536	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.	0
537	CLINTON	Well, there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail.	0
538	CLINTON	We agree on that.	0
539	CLINTON	But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession.	0
540	CLINTON	Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing.	0
541	CLINTON	He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama.	0
542	CLINTON	Now, I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the Dodd-Frank...	0
543	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
544	CLINTON	The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s.	0
545	CLINTON	So I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.	0
546	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
547	SANDERS	OK. First of all...	0
548	HOLT	Senator Sanders, your response.	0
549	SANDERS	Set the record right.	0
550	SANDERS	In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected.	0
551	SANDERS	He and I are friends.	0
552	SANDERS	We've worked together on many issues.	0
553	SANDERS	We have some differences of opinion.	0
554	SANDERS	But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals?	0
555	SANDERS	So it's easy to say, well, I'm going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.	0
556	SANDERS	I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC.	0
557	SANDERS	I do not want Wall Street's money.	0
558	SANDERS	I'll rely on the middle class and working families...	0
559	HOLT	That's time.	0

565	CLINTON	You know, I think since — since Senator Standers followed up on this...	0
566	HOLT	Thirty-second response.	0
567	CLINTON	Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.	0
568	CLINTON	But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.	0
569	O'MALLEY	That's not true.	0
570	CLINTON	It builds on the Dodd-Frank — yes, it is.	0
571	CLINTON	It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...	0
572	O'MALLEY	It's just not true.	0
573	CLINTON	... but it goes much further, because...	0
574	O'MALLEY	Oh, come on.	0
575	CLINTON	... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks.	0
576	CLINTON	Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.	0
577	CLINTON	And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I'm the one they don't want to be up against.	0

579	HOLT	Governor O'Malley.	0
580	O'MALLEY	Yes, thank you.	0
581	O'MALLEY	Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true.	0
582	O'MALLEY	What — I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street.	0
583	O'MALLEY	I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.	0
584	O'MALLEY	Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again.	0
585	O'MALLEY	The same thing is true with people in suits.	0
586	O'MALLEY	Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true.	0
587	O'MALLEY	I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.	0
588	O'MALLEY	In prior debates I've heard you even bring up — I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.	0
589	O'MALLEY	In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it.	0
590	O'MALLEY	The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.	0
591	O'MALLEY	And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street.	0
592	O'MALLEY	And we're just as vulnerable today.	0
593	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.	0
594	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
595	CLINTON	Yes, well, first of all — first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan.	0
596	CLINTON	Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank.	0
597	CLINTON	It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...	0
598	O'MALLEY	And we have never used it.	0
599	CLINTON	That pose a risk to the financial sector.	0
600	CLINTON	I want to go further and add to that.	0
601	CLINTON	And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street.	0
602	CLINTON	You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association...	0
603	O'MALLEY	Yes, but I haven't gotten a penny this year...	0

610	CLINTON	Yes, well, the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what's in Dodd-Frank, and what's in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...	0

613	SANDERS	Let me give you an example of how corrupt — how corrupt this system is.	0
614	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion.	0
615	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.	0
616	O'MALLEY	Say it.	0
617	SANDERS	The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.	0
618	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton — and you're not the only one, so I don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.	0
619	SANDERS	I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.	0

623	CLINTON	Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08.	0
624	CLINTON	So there's plenty...	0
625	SANDERS	If you want to...	0
626	CLINTON	There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together.	0

642	SANDERS	... Yeah...	0

644	MITCHELL	You've been specific about what you want, but let's talk about how to pay for all this.	0
645	MITCHELL	You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan.	0
646	MITCHELL	You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things...	0
647	SANDERS	... That's true.	0
648	MITCHELL	... Will you tell us tonight?	0
649	SANDERS	Good.	0
650	SANDERS	You're right.	0
651	SANDERS	I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs.	0
652	SANDERS	We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes.	0
653	SANDERS	Yes, I do.	0
654	SANDERS	I plead guilty.	0
655	SANDERS	I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free.	0
656	SANDERS	And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.	0
657	SANDERS	How do I pay for it?	0
658	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
659	SANDERS	I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
660	SANDERS	This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street.	0

667	O'MALLEY	...	0
668	O'MALLEY	The only person on this stage who has...	0
669	MITCHELL	... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier — Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?	0
670	CLINTON	Well, I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know.	0
671	CLINTON	And, you can go to my website and actually see that.	0
672	CLINTON	But, there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do.	0
673	CLINTON	And, I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class.	0
674	CLINTON	I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave.	0
675	CLINTON	To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.	0
676	CLINTON	Yeah, and that will also come out of the — some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...	0
677	MITCHELL	OK, we're out of time.	0

680	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
681	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders...	0
682	SANDERS	...	0
683	SANDERS	Here is the main two points...	0
684	MITCHELL	...	0
685	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes.	0
686	SANDERS	Yeah.	0
687	MITCHELL	The most googled political issue...	0
688	SANDERS	...	0
689	SANDERS	I got it.	0
690	MITCHELL	In the last month was taxes.	0
691	MITCHELL	Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also.	0
692	MITCHELL	Is that correct?	0
693	SANDERS	What is correct, and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism.	0
694	SANDERS	It's a Republican criticism.	0
695	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families.	0
696	SANDERS	So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.	0
697	SANDERS	So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs.	0
698	SANDERS	A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums.	0
699	SANDERS	It's a pretty good deal.	0
700	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
701	MITCHELL	Senator — Senator, let me just follow up on that.	0
702	SANDERS	Yeah.	0
703	MITCHELL	On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave.	0
704	MITCHELL	And, having said that, now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well.	0
705	MITCHELL	Is that breaking your word?	0
706	SANDERS	No, it is not breaking my word.	0
707	SANDERS	When you are — it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.	0
708	SANDERS	So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.	0
709	O'MALLEY	Senator, I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.	0
710	SANDERS	I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.	0
711	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
712	O'MALLEY	OK.	0
713	O'MALLEY	So, that was eight years.	0
714	O'MALLEY	Yes.	0
715	O'MALLEY	And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time — I mean, during a recession.	0
716	O'MALLEY	And Andrea, the — I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation.	0
717	O'MALLEY	We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.	0
718	O'MALLEY	The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal — like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.	0
719	O'MALLEY	And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.	0
720	O'MALLEY	And if we tax earnings from investments on money — namely capital gains — at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.	0
721	HOLT	We have got a lot to ground to cover here.	0

725	ANNOUNCER	Hello from MinuteEarth.	0
726	ANNOUNCER	Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.	0
727	ANNOUNCER	But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.	0
728	ANNOUNCER	Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.	0
729	ANNOUNCER	Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition.	0
730	ANNOUNCER	But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.	0
731	ANNOUNCER	In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.	0

733	HOLT	Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.	0
734	HOLT	How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?	0
735	SANDERS	I think we already are.	0
736	SANDERS	Younger generation understands it instinctively.	0
737	SANDERS	I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees.	0
738	SANDERS	People in Vermont know what's going on.	0
739	SANDERS	People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.	0
740	SANDERS	I'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees.	0
741	SANDERS	The debate is over.	0
742	SANDERS	Climate change is real.	0
743	SANDERS	It is already causing major problems.	0
744	SANDERS	And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.	0
745	SANDERS	It is amazing to me, and I think we'll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.	0
746	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
747	SANDERS	It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.	0
748	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
749	SANDERS	Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs.	0
750	SANDERS	We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.	0
751	SANDERS	I've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that.	0

773	MITCHELL	Iran is getting it's billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home.	0
774	MITCHELL	The president said today, "it's a good day.	0
775	MITCHELL	It's a good day for diplomacy.	0
776	MITCHELL	It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran."	0
777	SANDERS	I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.	0
778	SANDERS	Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.	0
779	SANDERS	On the other hand, the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement, something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war.	0
780	SANDERS	And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step.	0
781	SANDERS	So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future?	0
782	SANDERS	Yes.	0
783	SANDERS	Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow?	0
784	SANDERS	No, I don't think we should.	0
785	SANDERS	But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.	0
786	MITCHELL	Your response Secretary Clinton?	0
787	CLINTON	Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement.	0
788	CLINTON	I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office.	0
789	CLINTON	I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran.	0
790	CLINTON	It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.	0
791	CLINTON	And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement.	0
792	CLINTON	But I think we still have to carefully watch them.	0
793	CLINTON	We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization.	0
794	CLINTON	And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement.	0
795	CLINTON	And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.	0
796	MITCHELL	You mentioned Syria.	0
797	MITCHELL	Let me ask you about Syria, all of you.	0
798	MITCHELL	Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there.	0
799	MITCHELL	Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?	0
800	MITCHELL	Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.	0
801	CLINTON	Absolutely not.	0
802	CLINTON	I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces.	0
803	CLINTON	It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.	0
804	CLINTON	I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space.	0
805	CLINTON	So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.	0
806	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no?	0
807	SANDERS	As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud.	0
808	SANDERS	I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this.	0
809	SANDERS	I think he is doing the right thing.	0
810	SANDERS	What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq.	0
811	SANDERS	To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.	0
812	O'MALLEY	Andrea...	0
813	MITCHELL	Governor O'Malley?	0
814	SANDERS	We should — we should learn — we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place.	0
815	SANDERS	And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries.	0
816	SANDERS	That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.	0
817	MITCHELL	Governor O'Malley.	0
818	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
819	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
820	O'MALLEY	Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition.	0
821	O'MALLEY	And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.	0
822	O'MALLEY	We need to learn the lessons from the past.	0
823	O'MALLEY	We do need to provide the special — special ops advisers, we need — do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances.	0
824	O'MALLEY	We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.	0
825	O'MALLEY	And I also want to add one other thing here.	0
826	O'MALLEY	I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids — kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground.	0
827	O'MALLEY	A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, "Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground."	0
828	O'MALLEY	Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.	0
829	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
830	MITCHELL	I have a question.	0
831	MITCHELL	I have a question for Senator Sanders.	0
832	MITCHELL	Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?	0
833	SANDERS	No.	0
834	SANDERS	I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.	0
835	SANDERS	Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition.	0
836	SANDERS	And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs.	0
837	SANDERS	And who rises up?	0
838	SANDERS	Groups like ISIS.	0
839	SANDERS	So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home.	0
840	SANDERS	And I supported what he did.	0
841	SANDERS	Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.	0
842	SANDERS	And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar.	0
843	SANDERS	Qatar happens to be the largest — wealthiest country per capita in the world.	0
844	SANDERS	They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.	0
845	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
846	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility.	0
847	MITCHELL	Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?	0
848	CLINTON	Look, I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome.	0
849	CLINTON	We were able to get the chemical weapons out.	0
850	CLINTON	I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey.	0
851	CLINTON	So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...	0
852	MITCHELL	But should he — should he have stuck to his...	0
853	CLINTON	Well — but — but...	0
854	MITCHELL	... line?	0
855	MITCHELL	Did it hurt U.S. credibility?	0
856	CLINTON	I think, as commander in chief, you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make.	0
857	CLINTON	I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.	0
858	CLINTON	And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region.	0
859	CLINTON	If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.	0
860	CLINTON	It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing.	0
861	CLINTON	Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.	0
862	CLINTON	So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region.	0
863	CLINTON	We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran.	0
864	CLINTON	You know, one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...	0
865	MITCHELL	Your time is up.	0
866	CLINTON	... and go after ISIS, which I don't think would be a good idea.	0
867	SANDERS	Let me just...	0
868	MITCHELL	Senator....	0
869	CLINTON	But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...	0
870	MITCHELL	You're out of time.	0
871	SANDERS	OK. Let me suggest...	0
872	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
873	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders.	0
874	SANDERS	Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said.	0
875	SANDERS	But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day.	0
876	SANDERS	We all know that.	0
877	SANDERS	And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people.	0
878	SANDERS	This is beyond disgusting.	0
879	SANDERS	But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS.	0
880	SANDERS	Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.	0
881	SANDERS	But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.	0
882	O'MALLEY	But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here.	0
883	O'MALLEY	And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.	0
884	O'MALLEY	We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need.	0
885	O'MALLEY	And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.	0
886	O'MALLEY	So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.	0
887	MITCHELL	Your time is us.	0
888	MITCHELL	Lester.	0
889	HOLT	Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago.	0
890	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009.	0
891	HOLT	Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria.	0
892	HOLT	As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?	0
893	CLINTON	Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia.	0
894	CLINTON	We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.	0
895	CLINTON	We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments.	0
896	CLINTON	So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.	0
897	CLINTON	When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission.	0
898	CLINTON	And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down.	0
899	CLINTON	And in fact, accused me of fomenting it.	0
900	CLINTON	So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.	0
901	HOLT	What's your relationship with him?	0
902	CLINTON	Well, my relationship with him, it's — it's interesting.	0
903	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
904	CLINTON	It's one, I think, of respect.	0
905	CLINTON	We've had some very tough dealings with one another.	0
906	CLINTON	And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.	0
907	CLINTON	And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.	0
908	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
909	HOLT	We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans.	0
910	HOLT	That brings us to YouTube and this question.	0
911	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]	0
912	BROWNLEE	Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.	0
913	BROWNLEE	I think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right.	0
914	BROWNLEE	Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.	0
915	BROWNLEE	So do you think it's possible to find common ground?	0
916	BROWNLEE	And where do you stand on privacy versus security?	0
917	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]	0
918	HOLT	So, Governor O'Malley.	0
919	O'MALLEY	Thank you.	0
920	O'MALLEY	I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.	0
921	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
922	O'MALLEY	And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.	0
923	O'MALLEY	So we're a collaborative people.	0
924	O'MALLEY	We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.	0
925	O'MALLEY	But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms.	0
926	O'MALLEY	And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.	0
927	O'MALLEY	I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there.	0
928	O'MALLEY	We need a public advocate.	0
929	O'MALLEY	We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.	0
930	HOLT	That's time.	0
931	HOLT	You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we've been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia.	0
932	HOLT	How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?	0
933	O'MALLEY	Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...	0
934	HOLT	That's a question to Senator Sanders.	0
935	HOLT	I wasn't clear, I apologize.	0
936	SANDERS	OK.	0
937	SANDERS	I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned.	0
938	SANDERS	But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.	0
939	SANDERS	You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.	0
940	SANDERS	And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology.	0
941	SANDERS	So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...	0
942	HOLT	But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?	0
943	SANDERS	Right.	0
944	SANDERS	What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.	0
945	SANDERS	But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.	0
946	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
947	HOLT	We have to go to a — we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.	0

951	HOLT	And welcome back to Charleston.	0
952	HOLT	As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off.	0
953	HOLT	I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.	0
954	O'MALLEY	Can I get 30 seconds, too?	0
955	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
956	SANDERS	Can I get 50 seconds?	0
957	HOLT	Secretary Clinton.	0
958	CLINTON	Well, I wanted to say, and I'll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.	0
959	CLINTON	We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world.	0
960	CLINTON	And then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.	0
961	CLINTON	And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.	0
962	CLINTON	We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.	0
963	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
964	HOLT	And Andrea has a follow-up.	0
965	O'MALLEY	And Andrea — Andrea — Andrea...	0
966	MITCHELL	Just a — just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton.	0
967	MITCHELL	Just a moment, Governor.	0
968	O'MALLEY	Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?	0
969	MITCHELL	But — but — Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down.	0
970	MITCHELL	They got nowhere.	0
971	CLINTON	That is not what I've heard.	0
972	CLINTON	Let me leave it at that.	0
973	O'MALLEY	Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.	0
974	O'MALLEY	Ever since the attacks of September 11th — 30 seconds.	0
975	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
976	O'MALLEY	Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.	0
977	O'MALLEY	Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we're almost like it's — your body's immune system.	0
978	O'MALLEY	It's able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it's better connected — the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.	0
979	O'MALLEY	But there's another front in this battle, and it is this.	0
980	O'MALLEY	That's the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims.	0
981	O'MALLEY	That can do more damage to our democracy than any...	0
982	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
983	HOLT	All right, that's time, and — and we do...	0
984	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
985	HOLT	...we do have to move on.	0
986	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...	0
987	SANDERS	Can I get a — can I just get a very brief response?	0
988	SANDERS	Very brief.	0
989	HOLT	Thirty — 30 — 30 seconds, Senator.	0
990	SANDERS	OK. One — and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O'Malley said.	0
991	SANDERS	But here's an issue that we also should talk about.	0
992	SANDERS	We have a $600 billion military budget.	0
993	SANDERS	It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.	0
994	SANDERS	Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.	1
995	SANDERS	Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.	1
996	SANDERS	We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.	0
997	HOLT	All right.	0
998	HOLT	Secretary Clinton...	0
999	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1000	HOLT	...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president.	0
1001	HOLT	You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can.	0
1002	HOLT	Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?	0
1003	CLINTON	Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there.	0
1004	CLINTON	And I...	0
1005	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1006	CLINTON	...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s — especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history — you bet.	0
1007	CLINTON	I'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.	0
1008	CLINTON	We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.	0
1009	HOLT	Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.	0
1010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1011	SANDERS	Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth.	0
1012	SANDERS	If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.	0
1013	SANDERS	So here's a promise that I make — and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is — Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.	0
1014	SANDERS	Here's a promise.	0
1015	SANDERS	If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have — bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.	0
1016	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1017	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question.	0
1018	MITCHELL	You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, "totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable."	0
1019	MITCHELL	Senator, do you regret saying that?	0
1020	SANDERS	I was asked a question.	0
1021	SANDERS	You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I — that question annoys me.	0
1022	SANDERS	I cannot walk down the street — Secretary Clinton knows this — without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.	0
1023	SANDERS	I have avoided doing that.	0
1024	SANDERS	Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.	0
1025	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1026	SANDERS	I was asked a question.	0
1027	MITCHELL	You didn't have to answer it that way, though.	0
1028	MITCHELL	Why did you?	0
1029	SANDERS	Well — then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes.	0

1035	SANDERS	Have I ever once said a word about that issue?	0
1036	SANDERS	No, I have not.	0

1053	HOLT	Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.	0
1054	O'MALLEY	There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here.	0
1055	O'MALLEY	We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining.	0
1056	O'MALLEY	We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.	0
1057	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1058	O'MALLEY	We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.	0
1059	O'MALLEY	I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us.	0
1060	O'MALLEY	Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good.	0
1061	O'MALLEY	There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.	0
1062	O'MALLEY	We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.	0
1063	HOLT	And that's time.	0
1064	O'MALLEY	Thanks a lot.	0
1065	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	0
1066	CLINTON	Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged.	0
1067	CLINTON	We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water.	0
1068	CLINTON	And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.	0
1069	CLINTON	He had request for help and he had basically stone walled.	0
1070	CLINTON	I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.	0
1071	CLINTON	So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help.	0
1072	CLINTON	I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V.	0
1073	CLINTON	show and I said, "it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."	0
1074	HOLT	And that's time.	0
1075	CLINTON	I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.	0
1076	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1077	HOLT	Thank you.	0
1078	HOLT	Senator Sanders?	0
1079	SANDERS	Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor.	0
1080	SANDERS	A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.	0
1081	SANDERS	Now, we are a great nation — and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight.	0
1082	SANDERS	Let's be honest and let's be truthful.	0
1083	SANDERS	Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.	0
1084	SANDERS	We've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process.	0
1085	SANDERS	To say loudly and clearly," that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors."	0
1086	HOLT	All right.	0
1087	HOLT	Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.	0
1088	HOLT	I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell.	0
1089	HOLT	This has been great.	0
1090	HOLT	It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.	0
