1	David Muir	Mr. President, I know you're only five days in.	0
2	David Muir	Has it changed you?	0
3	Donald Trump	I don't want to change too much.	0
4	Donald Trump	I've had a wonderful life and wonderful success.	0
5	Donald Trump	I want to make this a great success for the American people and for the people that put me in this position.	0
6	Donald Trump	So I don't want to change too much.	0
7	Donald Trump	I can be the most presidential person ever, other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln, all right?	0
8	Donald Trump	But I can be the most presidential person.	0
9	Donald Trump	But I may not be able to do the job nearly as well if I do that.	0
10	David Muir	Your predecessor used to talk often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs -- the stairwell's right over here -- to have dinner with them.	0
11	David Muir	And I know that the first lady, Melania, has a big job back in New York taking care of Barron.	0
12	Donald Trump	She does, yes.	0
13	David Muir	Does it make it a lonely place for you at the end of the day?	0
14	Donald Trump	No, because I end up working longer.	0
15	Donald Trump	And that's OK.	0
16	Donald Trump	I -- I mean, I'm working long hours.	0
17	Donald Trump	I mean, the country has a lot of problems.	0
18	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]	0
19	Donald Trump	He says a lot of problems, and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already.	0
20	David Muir	Mr. President, I want to start -- we're five days in.	0
21	David Muir	And your campaign promises, I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall.	0
22	Donald Trump	Correct.	0
23	David Muir	Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall?	0
24	David Muir	Will American taxpayers pay for the wall?	0
25	Donald Trump	Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico.	0
26	Donald Trump	We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon.	0
27	Donald Trump	And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said...	0
28	David Muir	So they'll pay us back?	0
29	Donald Trump	Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent, yes.	0
30	David Muir	So the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first?	0
31	Donald Trump	All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico.	0
32	Donald Trump	Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall.	0
33	Donald Trump	But I want to build the wall.	0
34	Donald Trump	We have to build the wall.	0
35	Donald Trump	We have to stop drugs from pouring in.	0
36	Donald Trump	We have to stop people from just pouring into our country.	0
37	Donald Trump	We have no idea where they're from.	0
38	Donald Trump	And I campaigned on the wall.	0
39	Donald Trump	And it's very important.	0
40	Donald Trump	But that wall will cost us nothing.	0
41	David Muir	But you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall.	0
42	David Muir	And you, again, say they'll pay us back.	0
43	David Muir	Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans."	0
44	David Muir	He says	0
45	Donald Trump	Well, I think he has -- David, I think he has to say that.	0
46	Donald Trump	He has to say that.	0
47	Donald Trump	But I'm just telling you, there will be a payment.	0
48	Donald Trump	It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.	0
49	Donald Trump	And you have to understand, what I'm doing is good for the United States.	0
50	Donald Trump	It's also going to be good for Mexico.	0
51	David Muir	What are you going to say to some of your supporters who might say, Wait a minute	0
52	Donald Trump	Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it.	0
53	Donald Trump	I never said they're going to pay from the start.	0
54	Donald Trump	I said Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
55	David Muir	When does construction begin?	0
56	Donald Trump	As soon as we can.	0
57	Donald Trump	As soon as we can physically do it, we're -- we're...	0
58	David Muir	Within months?	0
59	Donald Trump	I would say in months, yeah.	0
60	Donald Trump	I would say in months.	0
61	Donald Trump	Certainly, planning is starting immediately.	0
62	David Muir	I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country.	0
63	David Muir	Right now, they're protected as so-called Dreamers, the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents.	0
64	David Muir	Should they be worried that they could be deported?	0
65	David Muir	And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay?	0
66	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be very worried.	0
67	Donald Trump	They are here illegally.	0
68	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be very worried.	0
69	Donald Trump	I do have a big heart.	0
70	Donald Trump	We're going to take care of everybody.	0
71	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very strong border.	0
72	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very solid border.	0
73	Donald Trump	Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried.	0
74	Donald Trump	We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.	0
75	David Muir	So, Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay?	0
76	Donald Trump	I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks.	0
77	David Muir	I want to ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House.	0
78	David Muir	You brought in congressional leaders to the White House.	0
79	David Muir	You spoke at length about the presidential election with them, telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 million to 5 million illegal votes.	0
80	David Muir	That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history.	0
81	David Muir	Where is the evidence of that?	0
82	Donald Trump	So, let me tell you, first of all, it was so misrepresented.	0
83	Donald Trump	That was supposed to be a confidential meeting.	0
84	Donald Trump	And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting.	0
85	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
86	David Muir	But you have tweeted about the millions of illegal...	0
87	Donald Trump	Let me -- sure.	0
88	Donald Trump	And I do -- and I'm very -- and I mean it.	0
89	Donald Trump	But just so you know, it was supposed to be a confidential meeting.	0
90	Donald Trump	They turned it into not a -- number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute.	0
91	Donald Trump	They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the -- it wasn't.	0
92	Donald Trump	It was hardly even discussed.	0
93	Donald Trump	I said it.	0
94	Donald Trump	And I said it strongly, because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible.	0
95	Donald Trump	That's number one.	0
96	Donald Trump	Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote.	0
97	Donald Trump	I would've gone to California, where I didn't go at all.	0
98	Donald Trump	I would've gone to New York, where I didn't campaign at all.	0
99	Donald Trump	I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to.	0
100	Donald Trump	And I would've won that much easier than winning the Electoral College.	0
101	Donald Trump	But as you know, the Electoral College is all that matters.	0
102	Donald Trump	It doesn't make any difference.	0
103	Donald Trump	With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration, you take a look at those registration for -- you're going to find -- and we're going to do an investigation on it...	1
104	David Muir	But three to five million illegal votes?	0
105	Donald Trump	Well, we're going to find out.	0
106	Donald Trump	But it could very well be that much.	0
107	Donald Trump	You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states.	1
108	Donald Trump	You have people registered in two states.	0
109	Donald Trump	They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey.	0
110	Donald Trump	They vote twice.	1
111	Donald Trump	There are millions of votes, in my opinion.	0
112	Donald Trump	Now...	0
113	MUIR	But again...	0
114	Donald Trump	I'm going to do an investigation.	0
115	Donald Trump	Now, David, David...	0
116	David Muir	You're now president of the United States.	0
117	Donald Trump	I'm -- well, of course.	0
118	Donald Trump	I want the voting process to be legitimate.	0
119	David Muir	But what I'm asking -- what I'm asking...	0
120	Donald Trump	People that...	0
121	David Muir	When you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election.	1
122	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
123	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
124	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
125	David Muir	You say you're going to launch an investigation.	0
126	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
127	Donald Trump	Done.	0
128	David Muir	What you have presented so far has been debunked.	0
129	David Muir	It's been called false.	0
130	Donald Trump	No, it hasn't.	0
131	Donald Trump	Take a look at the Pew reports.	0
132	David Muir	I called the author of the Pew report last night.	0
133	David Muir	And he told me that they found no evidence of voter fraud.	1
134	Donald Trump	Really?	0
135	Donald Trump	Then why did he write the report?	0
136	David Muir	He said no evidence of voter fraud.	0
137	Donald Trump	Excuse me.	0
138	Donald Trump	Then why did he write the report?	0
139	David Muir	So I guess I'm...	0
140	Donald Trump	According to Pew report.	0
141	Donald Trump	Then he's -- then he's groveling again.	0
142	Donald Trump	You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear, but not necessarily millions of people want to hear, or have to hear.	0
143	Donald Trump	This is...	0
144	David Muir	So you've launched an investigation?	0
145	Donald Trump	We're going to launch an investigation to find out.	0
146	Donald Trump	And then the next time -- and -- and I will say this.	0
147	Donald Trump	Of those votes cast, none of them come to me.	0
148	Donald Trump	None of them come to me.	0
149	Donald Trump	They would all be for the other side.	0
150	Donald Trump	None of them come to me.	0
151	Donald Trump	But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal, and two states.	0
152	Donald Trump	And some cases, maybe three states?	0
153	Donald Trump	We have a lot to look into.	0
154	David Muir	House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, I have seen no evidence.	0
155	David Muir	I have made this very	0
156	Donald Trump	There's nothing bigger.	0
157	Donald Trump	There's nothing bigger.	0
158	David Muir	But it is important, because you have...	0
159	Donald Trump	Well, let me just tell you, you know what's important?	0
160	Donald Trump	Millions of people agree with me when I say that.	0
161	Donald Trump	If you would have looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in, they're saying, We agree with Mr. Trump.	0
162	Donald Trump	We agree."	0
163	Donald Trump	They're very smart people.	0
164	Donald Trump	ell	0
165	David Muir	Let me just ask you, you did win.	0
166	David Muir	You're the president.	0
167	David Muir	You're sitting across from me right now.	0
168	Donald Trump	That's true.	0
169	Donald Trump	That's true.	0
170	David Muir	Do you think that your words matter more now?	0
171	Donald Trump	Yes, very much.	0
172	David Muir	Do you think that -- that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country...	0
173	Donald Trump	No, not at all.	0
174	David Muir	... without presenting the evidence?	0
175	Donald Trump	Not at all.	0
176	Donald Trump	Because many people feel the same way that I do.	0
177	Donald Trump	And...	0
178	David Muir	You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?	1
179	Donald Trump	No, not at all.	0
180	Donald Trump	Because they wouldn't -- they didn't come to me, believe me.	1
181	Donald Trump	Those were Hillary votes.	0
182	David Muir	Mr. President, I just have one more question on this.	0
183	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
184	David Muir	And it's -- it's -- it's bigger picture.	0
185	David Muir	You -- you took some heat -- after your visit to the CIA, in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA, you talked about other things, but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine.	0
186	David Muir	And I just want to ask you, when does all of that matter just a little less?	0
187	David Muir	When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president?	0
188	Donald Trump	OK, so I'm glad you asked.	0
189	Donald Trump	So I went to the CIA, my first stop.	0
190	Donald Trump	I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA.	0
191	Donald Trump	I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders.	0
192	Donald Trump	But that's OK.	0
193	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.	0
194	Donald Trump	That speech was a homerun.	0
195	Donald Trump	That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention your network -- read -- see what Fox said.	0
196	Donald Trump	They said it was one of the great speeches.	0
197	Donald Trump	They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA.	0
198	Donald Trump	There was nobody -- somebody was asking Sean, Well	0
199	David Muir	And you would give the same speech if you went back?	0
200	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
201	David Muir	In front of that wall?	0
202	Donald Trump	It was great.	0
203	Donald Trump	People loved it.	0
204	Donald Trump	They loved it.	0
205	Donald Trump	They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time.	0
206	Donald Trump	They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech.	0
207	Donald Trump	There was love in the room.	0
208	Donald Trump	You and other networks covered it very inaccurately.	0
209	Donald Trump	I hate to say this to you, and you probably won't put it on, but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech.	0
210	Donald Trump	That speech was a good speech.	0
211	Donald Trump	And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech.	0
212	Donald Trump	And it was very, very unfortunate that you did.	0
213	David Muir	I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size.	0
214	David Muir	Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues?	0
215	Donald Trump	Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again.	0
216	Donald Trump	Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly -- because we had a massive crowd of people -- we -- we had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, Wow."	0
217	Donald Trump	And I've seen crowds before.	0
218	Donald Trump	Big	0
219	Donald Trump	When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches.	0
220	Donald Trump	I said, the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again.	0
221	Donald Trump	Therefore, I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me.	0
222	Donald Trump	But more importantly, they like what I'm saying.	0

237	David Muir	Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week.	0
238	David Muir	Chicago, last night, you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago, saying, If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on	0
239	Donald Trump	Right.	0
240	David Muir	You will send in the feds.	0
241	David Muir	What do you mean by that?	0
242	Donald Trump	It's carnage.	0
243	Donald Trump	You know, in my speech, I got tremendous -- from certain people, the word carnage.	0
244	Donald Trump	It is carnage.	0
245	Donald Trump	It's horrible carnage.	0
246	Donald Trump	This is -- Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.	0
247	Donald Trump	People are being shot left and right.	0
248	Donald Trump	Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time.	0
249	Donald Trump	This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe.	0
250	Donald Trump	They're not doing the job.	0
251	Donald Trump	Now, if they want help, I would love to help them.	0
252	Donald Trump	I will send in what we have to send in.	0
253	Donald Trump	Maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct.	0
254	Donald Trump	Maybe they're being overly political correct?	0
255	Donald Trump	Maybe there's something going on?	0
256	Donald Trump	But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago.	0
257	Donald Trump	Chicago is like a warzone.	0
258	Donald Trump	Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report, in some of the places that you report about every night, in the Middle East.	0
259	David Muir	So I will -- you mention federal assistance.	0
260	David Muir	There's federal assistance, and then there's sending in the feds.	0
261	David Muir	I'm just curious, will you take action on your own?	0
262	Donald Trump	I want them to fix the problem.	0
263	Donald Trump	You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of.	0
264	Donald Trump	Maybe it's OK if somebody else is president.	0
265	Donald Trump	I want them to fix the problem.	0
266	Donald Trump	They have a problem that's very easily fixable.	0
267	Donald Trump	They're going to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter, but they got to fix the problem.	0
268	Donald Trump	I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where, essentially, I'm the president.	0
269	Donald Trump	I love Chicago.	0
270	Donald Trump	I know Chicago.	0
271	Donald Trump	And Chicago is a great city.	0
272	Donald Trump	It can be a great city.	0
273	Donald Trump	It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread.	0
274	Donald Trump	It can't be a great city.	0
275	David Muir	And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds?	0
276	Donald Trump	Well, so far they have been unable -- it's been going on for years.	0
277	Donald Trump	And I wasn't president.	0
278	Donald Trump	What's going on?	0
279	Donald Trump	So all I'm saying is, to the mayor, who came up to my office recently, I say, you have to smarten up and you have to toughen up.	0
280	Donald Trump	Because you can't let that happen.	0
281	Donald Trump	That's a warzone.	0
282	David Muir	This is a warning.	0
283	Donald Trump	I want them to straighten out the problem.	0
284	Donald Trump	It's a big problem.	0
285	David Muir	Let me ask you about a new report that you are poised to lift a ban on so-called CIA black sites, prisons around the world that have been used in the past.	0
286	David Muir	Is that true?	0
287	Donald Trump	Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours.	0
288	David Muir	Are you going to lift the ban?	0
289	Donald Trump	You're going to see in about two hours.	0
290	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]	0
291	Donald Trump	Tonight, we are still waiting for word from the Trump White House on any decision involving those so-called black sites.	0
292	David Muir	The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture.	0
293	David Muir	Will you say that?	0
294	Donald Trump	Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture.	0
295	Donald Trump	As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate.	0
296	Donald Trump	He's a fantastic guy.	0
297	Donald Trump	He's going to be the head of the CIA.	0
298	Donald Trump	And you will have somebody fabulous, as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all.	0
299	Donald Trump	And he will, I think, do a great job.	0
300	Donald Trump	And he is, you know -- I haven't gone into great detail, but I will tell you, I have spoken to others in intelligence and they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding.	0
301	David Muir	You did tell me...	0
302	Donald Trump	Because they say it does work.	0
303	Donald Trump	It does work.	0
304	David Muir	Mr. President...	0
305	Donald Trump	Now, personally...	0
306	David Muir	Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse, in your words.	0
307	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
308	Donald Trump	I would do -- what I would do -- I want to keep our country safe.	0
309	Donald Trump	I want to keep our country safe.	0
310	David Muir	What does that mean?	0
311	Donald Trump	When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they are chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?	0
312	Donald Trump	As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.	0
313	Donald Trump	Now, with that being said, I'm going with General Mattis.	0
314	Donald Trump	I'm going with my secretary, because I think Pompeo is going to be phenomenon.	0
315	Donald Trump	I'm going to go with what they say.	0
316	Donald Trump	But I have spoken, as recently as 24 hours ago, with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question.	0
317	Donald Trump	Does it work?	0
318	Donald Trump	Does torture work?	0
319	Donald Trump	And the answer was: Yes, absolutely.	1
320	David Muir	You're now the president.	0
321	David Muir	Do you want waterboarding?	0
322	Donald Trump	I don't want people to chop off the citizens' or anybody's heads in the Middle East, OK?	0
323	Donald Trump	Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else.	0
324	Donald Trump	I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different.	0
325	Donald Trump	You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago.	0
326	Donald Trump	Now they chop them off, and they put them on camera, and they send them all over the world.	0
327	Donald Trump	So we have that.	0
328	Donald Trump	And we're not allowed to do anything.	0
329	Donald Trump	We're not playing on an even field.	0
330	Donald Trump	I will say this.	0
331	Donald Trump	I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group.	0
332	Donald Trump	And if they don't want to do, that's fine.	0
333	Donald Trump	If they do want to do, then I will work toward that end.	0
334	Donald Trump	I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally.	0
335	Donald Trump	But do I feel it works?	0

345	Donald Trump	Right, so many.	0
346	Donald Trump	It's amazing.	0
347	David Muir	Let me ask you.	0
348	David Muir	Right after the oath of office, they give you the nuclear codes, the biscuit."	0
349	David Muir	Sobering moment?	0
350	David Muir	et me ask you.	0
351	David Muir	Right after the"	0
352	Donald Trump	When they explained what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about, it is a very sobering moment, yes.	0
353	Donald Trump	It's very, very -- very scary, in a sense.	0
354	David Muir	Does it keep you up at night?	0
355	Donald Trump	No.	0
356	Donald Trump	But it's -- confident that I'll do the right thing.	0
357	Donald Trump	The right job.	0
358	Donald Trump	But it's a very, very scary thing.	0
359	David Muir	Every president does get asked, though, what keeps them awake, what's unsettling.	0
360	David Muir	What has been most unsettling for you now that you're five days in?	0
361	Donald Trump	Well, I think I see a tremendous amount of waste.	0
362	Donald Trump	I see a tremendous amount of job opportunities that have been let go for many years, and I'm not just talking about President Obama.	0
363	Donald Trump	I'm talking about for many, many years.	0
364	Donald Trump	And I was a big, big fan of Ronald Reagan, but I was a never big fan on trade with respect to Ronald Reagan.	0
365	David Muir	So the economy...	0
366	Donald Trump	I just think we've had years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country, and there's no reason for it.	0
367	David Muir	So the economy keeps you up more than terrorism and homeland security?	0
368	Donald Trump	I view it all the same.	0

383	David Muir	Who are we talking about?	0

385	Donald Trump	We're talking about -- no, it's not the Muslim ban, but it's countries that have tremendous terror.	0
386	Donald Trump	And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems.	0
387	Donald Trump	Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in, who in many cases, or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction.	0
388	David Muir	Which countries are we talking about?	0
389	Donald Trump	You look at what's happened - I have a whole list.	0
390	Donald Trump	You will be very thrilled.	0
391	Donald Trump	You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions.	0
392	Donald Trump	I don't want that.	0
393	Donald Trump	They're ISIS.	0

396	Donald Trump	I'm going to be the president of a safe country.	0
397	Donald Trump	We have enough problems.	0
398	Donald Trump	Now, I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people.	0
399	Donald Trump	I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries.	0
400	Donald Trump	And all you have to do is take a look.	0
401	Donald Trump	It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there.	0

445	David Muir	You said, We should have kept the oil	0
446	Donald Trump	Well, we should have kept the oil when we got out.	0
447	Donald Trump	And you know, it's very interesting.	0
448	Donald Trump	Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil.	0
449	Donald Trump	That's where they got the money.	0
450	David Muir	So you believe we can go in and take the oil?	0
451	Donald Trump	We should have taken the oil.	0
452	Donald Trump	You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil.	0
453	David Muir	You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil.	0
454	David Muir	But I want to get to the words that you said...	0
455	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?	0
456	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.	0
457	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?	0
458	Donald Trump	Who are the critics that say that?	0
459	Donald Trump	Fools.	0
460	Donald Trump	I don't call them critics.	0
461	Donald Trump	I call them fools.	0
462	David Muir	Let me talk about your words...	0
463	Donald Trump	We should have kept -- excuse me.	0
464	Donald Trump	We should have taken the oil.	0
465	Donald Trump	And if we took the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, and we would have had wealth.	0
466	Donald Trump	We have spent, right now, $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our country is falling apart.	0
467	Donald Trump	It's not right.	0
468	David Muir	What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said maybe we'll have another chance.	0
469	Donald Trump	Well, don't let it get your attention too much, because we'll see what happens.	0
470	Donald Trump	I mean, we're going to see what happens.	0
471	Donald Trump	You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk, when it comes to the military, I don't want to discuss things.	0
472	Donald Trump	I want to let -- I want to let the action take place before the talk takes place.	0
473	Donald Trump	I watched in Mosul, when -- a number of months ago, generals and politicians would get up and say, we're going into Mosul in four months.	0
474	Donald Trump	Then they'd say we're going in, in three months, two months, one month, we're going in next week.	0
475	Donald Trump	OK. And I kept saying to myself, gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?	0
476	Donald Trump	All right.	0
477	Donald Trump	So now they go in, and it is tough, because they've given the enemy all this time to prepare.	0
478	Donald Trump	I don't want to do a lot of talking on the military.	0
479	Donald Trump	I want to talk after it's finished, not before it starts.	0

485	Donald Trump	And later, the moment in the Oval Office, President Trump revealing the conversation with President Obama, as they got into the motorcade, sharing that ride to the Capitol.	0

489	SYSTEM	[Commercial Break]	0
490	David Muir	Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare, to repeal it.	0
491	David Muir	And you told the Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody.	0
492	David Muir	That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage.	0
493	Donald Trump	It's going to be -- what my plan is, is that I want to take care of everybody.	0
494	Donald Trump	I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance.	0
495	Donald Trump	Just so you understand, people talk about Obamacare, and I told the Republicans this.	0
496	Donald Trump	The best thing we can do is nothing for two years, let it explode, and then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and the Democrats will vote for it, believe me.	0
497	Donald Trump	Because this year, you'll have 150 percent increases.	0
498	Donald Trump	Last year, in Arizona, 116 percent increase.	0
499	Donald Trump	Minnesota, sixty some odd percent increase.	0
500	Donald Trump	And I told them -- except for one problem.	0
501	Donald Trump	I want to get it fixed.	0
502	Donald Trump	The best thing I could do as the leader of this country, but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years, they'd be begging me to do something.	0
503	Donald Trump	But I don't want to do that.	0
504	Donald Trump	So just so you -- Obamacare is a disaster.	0
505	Donald Trump	It's too expensive.	0
506	Donald Trump	It's horrible health care.	0
507	Donald Trump	It doesn't cover what you have to cover.	0
508	Donald Trump	It's a disaster.	0
509	Donald Trump	I said to the Republican folks, and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan.	0
510	Donald Trump	I said, look, if you go fast -- and I'm OK in doing it, because it's the right thing to do -- we want to get good coverage at much less cost -- I said, if you go fast, we then own Obamacare.	0
511	Donald Trump	They're going to put it on us.	0
512	Donald Trump	And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode.	0
513	Donald Trump	If you sit back and let it explode, it's going to be much easier.	0
514	Donald Trump	That's the thing to do.	0
515	Donald Trump	But the right thing to do is to get something done now.	0
516	Donald Trump	I want to make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president.	0
517	David Muir	You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement.	0
518	David Muir	Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?	0
519	Donald Trump	So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it.	0
520	Donald Trump	You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their healthcare and their doctor and where they went.	0
521	Donald Trump	You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.	0
522	David Muir	I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.	0
523	Donald Trump	No, no, we -- here's what I can assure you.	0
524	Donald Trump	We are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want.	0
525	Donald Trump	We're going to have a much better health care plan at much less money.	0
526	Donald Trump	We're going to have an explosion.	0
527	Donald Trump	And to do it right, sit back, let it explode, and let the Democrats come begging us to help them, because it's on them.	0
528	Donald Trump	But I don't want to do that.	0
529	Donald Trump	I want to give great health care at a much lower cost.	0
530	David Muir	So no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up with anything less?	0
531	Donald Trump	Well, you know, when you say no one, I think no one.	0
532	Donald Trump	Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people -- will no one?	0
533	Donald Trump	And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt.	0
534	Donald Trump	OK. We want no one.	0
535	Donald Trump	We want the answer to be no one.	0
536	Donald Trump	But I will say: Millions of people will be happy.	0
537	Donald Trump	Right now, you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy.	0

548	Donald Trump	You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday.	0
549	Donald Trump	And I will say this -- and I didn't realize this, but I was told -- you will have a very large crowd of people.	0
550	Donald Trump	I don't know, as large or larger.	0
551	Donald Trump	Some people say it's going to be larger, pro-life people, and they say the press doesn't cover them.	0
552	David Muir	I don't want to compare crowd sizes again.	0
553	Donald Trump	No, you shouldn't.	0
554	Donald Trump	But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them.	0
555	David Muir	We saw the marches around the country.	0
556	David Muir	And you are their president now.	0
557	David Muir	Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them?	0
558	David Muir	And for those women, men, children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?	0
559	Donald Trump	Well, I do, but I have to also say: We just had an election a few weeks ago.	0
560	Donald Trump	And they voted, in many cases, and some cases, they didn't vote, I imagine.	0
561	Donald Trump	And we did have an election.	0

581	Donald Trump	What's happened here.	0
582	Donald Trump	I actually put some pictures up that I thought would be great.	0
583	Donald Trump	Some of the paintings that I thought would be really appropriate, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, who a lot of people, they compare the campaign of Trump with, the campaign of -- you have to go back to 1828, but that seems to be a comparison for, you know, certain obvious reasons.	0
584	Donald Trump	But we put some of these up.	0
585	David Muir	And we're standing on -- we're standing on Ronald Reagan's rug?	0
586	Donald Trump	This was Ronald Reagan's.	0

597	Donald Trump	This was given to me by one of the combatants that I fought to get here, and Adams versus Jefferson, and this book, they say this was the most vicious campaign ever fought for president until this.	0
598	David Muir	Who gave this to you?	0
599	Donald Trump	Somebody.	0
600	Donald Trump	A combatant.	0
601	Donald Trump	And this was the letter given to me by President Obama.	0
602	David Muir	We saw that image of him the final morning that he was here putting the letter on the desk.	0
603	Donald Trump	Which was -- I won't show it to you or read it to you.	0
604	Donald Trump	But a -- just a beautiful letter.	0
605	David Muir	Is there a line you can share that struck you most?	0
606	Donald Trump	There were numerous lines.	0
607	Donald Trump	So well-written.	0
608	Donald Trump	So thoughtful.	0
609	Donald Trump	So thoughtful.	0
610	Donald Trump	And in the drawer, you know, put in the drawer, which is a custom, but I doubt too many of them were written in this manner.	0
611	Donald Trump	He really -- in fact, I called him and thanked him for the thought that was put into that letter.	0
612	David Muir	I have to say, I have looked at a lot of those presidential letters that they have left for the next president.	0
613	David Muir	That one looks a lot longer than the ones that I have seen.	0
614	Donald Trump	It was long, it was complex, it was thoughtful, and it took time to do it, and I appreciated it.	0
615	Donald Trump	And I called him and thanked him.	0
616	David Muir	Was there something he said in that letter that surprised you?	0
617	Donald Trump	Well, I think nothing that surprised me, but it was stated beautifully.	0
618	Donald Trump	But -- and I'm representing a lot of people, and I'm carrying on a very important tradition, and just do a great job.	0
619	Donald Trump	He wants me to do a great job.	0
620	Donald Trump	He said something that was very interesting to me.	0
621	Donald Trump	He said, you know, if I thought your health care plan was going to be better than his plan, Obamacare, I would support it, and I believe he would.	0
622	Donald Trump	I believe he would.	0
623	David Muir	What was that car ride like to the Capitol, when you got into the car with the president who was about to leave, and you were about to...	0
624	Donald Trump	The amazing thing to me -- and he may say differently -- is that we I think have sort of a great relationship, and yet it was a vicious campaign, and vicious things were said by him and by me about each other.	0
625	Donald Trump	I mean, he said that, you know, I would never represent the Republican Party.	0
626	Donald Trump	Then, I won, that I will never win.	0
627	Donald Trump	And I said vicious things about him.	0
628	Donald Trump	It was a very -- you know, you talk about Jefferson and Adams.	0
629	Donald Trump	This was rough.	0
630	Donald Trump	And Hillary had a great asset on her side, him and Michelle, who is a phenomenal person.	0
631	Donald Trump	But Hillary had these two people that were really campaigning, big league.	0
632	Donald Trump	In fact, I was going out and campaigning -- you know, really complaining about it.	0
633	Donald Trump	I was saying, not really fair.	0
634	Donald Trump	But to have that kind of vitriol, to have that kind of stuff going on, and then we're riding in a car together up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I'm saying to myself -- I actually said to him, This is a little weird	0
635	Donald Trump	But we really -- we didn't discuss the negative.	0
636	Donald Trump	We only discussed the future and the positive.	0
637	Donald Trump	And we really got along well.	0
638	Donald Trump	Now, again, he may say differently, but I don't think he would.	0
639	Donald Trump	We really got along well.	0
640	David Muir	Mr. President, you bring up Hillary Clinton.	0
641	David Muir	You had her stand up at Statuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.	0

644	David Muir	Do you think America is done hearing about investigations into Hillary Clinton?	0

647	Donald Trump	From my standpoint, we want to move onto the future.	0
