1	LESLEY STAHL	Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?	1
2	TRUMP	I think something's happening.	0
3	TRUMP	Something's changing and it'll change back again.	0
4	TRUMP	I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.	1
5	TRUMP	But I don't know that it's manmade.	1
6	TRUMP	I will say this.	0
7	TRUMP	I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.	0
8	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.	0
9	TRUMP	I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.	0
10	LESLEY STAHL	I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.	0
11	TRUMP	And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.	0
12	TRUMP	You don't know.	0
13	LESLEY STAHL	Well, your scientists, your scientists--	0
14	TRUMP	No, we have--	0
15	LESLEY STAHL	At NOAA and NASA--	0
16	TRUMP	We have scientists that disagree with that.	0
17	LESLEY STAHL	You know, I was thinking what if he said, "No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."	0
18	LESLEY STAHL	And I thought, "Wow, what an impact."	0
19	TRUMP	Well-- I'm not denying.	0
20	LESLEY STAHL	What an impact that would make.	0
21	TRUMP	I'm not denying climate change.	0
22	TRUMP	But it could very well go back.	0
23	TRUMP	You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--	0
24	LESLEY STAHL	But that's denying it.	0
25	TRUMP	--of years.	0
26	TRUMP	They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.	0
27	LESLEY STAHL	Who says that?	0
28	LESLEY STAHL	They say?	0
29	TRUMP	People say.	0
30	TRUMP	People say that in the--	0
31	LESLEY STAHL	Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?	0
32	TRUMP	You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.	0
33	LESLEY STAHL	I can't bring them in.	0
34	TRUMP	Look, scientists also have a political agenda.	0
35	LESLEY STAHL	Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist--	0
36	TRUMP	Yes.	0
37	TRUMP	Yes.	0
38	LESLEY STAHL	--the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis?	0
39	LESLEY STAHL	And did the prince give the order to kill him?	0
40	TRUMP	Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out.	0
41	TRUMP	It's being investigated.	0
42	TRUMP	It's being looked at very, very strongly.	0
43	TRUMP	And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.	0
44	TRUMP	As of this moment, they deny it.	0
45	TRUMP	And den-- deny it vehemently.	0
46	TRUMP	Could it be them?	0
47	TRUMP	Yes.	0
48	LESLEY STAHL	Jared, your son-in-law.	0
49	LESLEY STAHL	Got on the phone and asked the prince.	0
50	LESLEY STAHL	Did he deny it?	0
51	LESLEY STAHL	Did he--	0
52	TRUMP	They deny it.	0
53	TRUMP	They deny it every way you can imagine.	0
54	TRUMP	In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer.	0
55	LESLEY STAHL	What are you options?	0
56	LESLEY STAHL	Let's say they did.	0
57	LESLEY STAHL	What are your options?	0
58	LESLEY STAHL	Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?	0
59	TRUMP	Well, it depends on what the sanction is.	0
60	TRUMP	I'll give ya an example.	0
61	TRUMP	They are ordering military equipment.	0
62	TRUMP	Everybody in the world wanted that order.	0
63	TRUMP	Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it.	0
64	TRUMP	We got it.	0
65	LESLEY STAHL	So would you cut that off--	0
66	TRUMP	I tell you what I don't wanna do.	0
67	TRUMP	Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs.	0
68	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose an order like that.	0
69	TRUMP	There are other ways of-- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.	0
70	LESLEY STAHL	Tell everybody what's at stake here.	0
71	LESLEY STAHL	You know---	0
72	TRUMP	Well, there's a lot at stake.	0
73	TRUMP	There's a lot at stake.	0
74	TRUMP	And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.	0
75	TRUMP	There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that.	0
76	TRUMP	There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case.	0
77	TRUMP	So we're gonna have to see.	0
78	TRUMP	We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.	0
79	LESLEY STAHL	You've had a string of wins lately.	0
80	LESLEY STAHL	Let's see, the economy, the d-- the trade deal-	0
81	TRUMP	Right.	0
82	LESLEY STAHL	With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh--	0
83	TRUMP	And South Korea.	0
84	LESLEY STAHL	And South Korea.	0
85	LESLEY STAHL	And Kavanaugh, the confirmation.	0
86	TRUMP	There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years--	1
87	LESLEY STAHL	Say, this is modesty.	0
88	TRUMP	Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.	0
89	LESLEY STAHL	What about North Korea?	0
90	LESLEY STAHL	Talking about accom--	0
91	TRUMP	Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement.	0
92	TRUMP	Look, we--	0
93	LESLEY STAHL	You say "so far"?	0
94	TRUMP	It's always so far, til everything's done.	0
95	TRUMP	I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?	0
96	TRUMP	Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter.	0
97	TRUMP	But I will say this.	0
98	TRUMP	The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea.	0
99	TRUMP	I sat with President Obama--	0
100	LESLEY STAHL	We were goin' to war?	0
101	TRUMP	--and-- we were gonna--I think it was going to end up in war.	0
102	TRUMP	And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get.	0
103	TRUMP	Doesn't get any tougher than that.	0
104	TRUMP	Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.	0
105	TRUMP	We were going to war with North Korea.	0
106	TRUMP	Now, you don't hear that.	0
107	TRUMP	You don't hear any talk of it.	0
108	TRUMP	And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it.	0
109	TRUMP	And you see that, he's agreed to it.	0
110	TRUMP	No missiles.	0
111	LESLEY STAHL	Do you trust him?	0
112	TRUMP	I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.	0
113	TRUMP	That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --	0
114	LESLEY STAHL	Why would--	0
115	TRUMP	about it?	0
116	LESLEY STAHL	you trust him?	0
117	TRUMP	Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you.	0
118	TRUMP	Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--	0
119	LESLEY STAHL	Well, remember what Reagan said.	0
120	LESLEY STAHL	Trust, but verify.	0
121	TRUMP	Sure.	0
122	TRUMP	I know.	0
123	TRUMP	It's-- it's very true.	0
124	TRUMP	But the fact is, I do trust him.	0
125	TRUMP	But we'll see what happens.	0
126	LESLEY STAHL	But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-	0
127	TRUMP	They want to--	0
128	LESLEY STAHL	With nuclear--	0
129	TRUMP	And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.	0
130	LESLEY STAHL	But--	0
131	TRUMP	Setting it up.	0
132	LESLEY STAHL	Is what I said true, that they haven't?	0
133	LESLEY STAHL	Gotten--	0
134	TRUMP	Well, nobody really knows.	0
135	TRUMP	I mean, people are saying that.	0
136	TRUMP	I've actually said that.	0
137	LESLEY STAHL	What?	0
138	LESLEY STAHL	That they're still building missiles, more missiles?	0
139	TRUMP	We don't really know, Lesley.	0
140	TRUMP	We really don't know.	0
141	TRUMP	But I assume--	0
142	LESLEY STAHL	Suspect that?	0
143	TRUMP	Let's say the answer is yes, okay?	0
144	TRUMP	In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile.	0
145	TRUMP	They haven't tested a rocket.	0
146	TRUMP	They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.	0
147	TRUMP	It sort of moves the earth.	0
148	TRUMP	And we have a relationship now.	0
149	LESLEY STAHL	One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.	0
150	TRUMP	We haven't done that.	0
151	LESLEY STAHL	Are you prepared to do that?	0
152	LESLEY STAHL	What-- what does he have to do--	0
153	TRUMP	No, no.	0
154	TRUMP	I--	0
155	LESLEY STAHL	Before you're--	0
156	TRUMP	No I'm not doing it.	0
157	TRUMP	This isn't the Obama administration.	0
158	TRUMP	I haven't eased the sanctions.	0
159	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.	0
160	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.	0
161	TRUMP	We're meeting.	0
162	TRUMP	I believe he likes me.	0
163	TRUMP	I like him.	0
164	TRUMP	We have a good relationship.	0
165	TRUMP	It's very important.	0
166	LESLEY STAHL	I wanna read you his resume, okay?	0
167	LESLEY STAHL	He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions.	0
168	LESLEY STAHL	This is a guy you love?	0
169	TRUMP	Sure.	0
170	TRUMP	I know all these things.	0
171	TRUMP	I mean-- I'm not a baby.	0
172	TRUMP	I know these things.	0
173	LESLEY STAHL	I know, but why do you love that guy?	0
174	TRUMP	Look, look.	0
175	TRUMP	I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?	0
176	LESLEY STAHL	But you love him.	0
177	TRUMP	Okay.	0
178	TRUMP	That's just a figure of speech.	0
179	LESLEY STAHL	No, it's like an embrace.	0
180	TRUMP	It well, let it be an embrace.	0
181	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.	0
182	LESLEY STAHL	He's a bad guy.	0
183	TRUMP	Look.	0
184	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is.	0
185	TRUMP	I get along with him really well.	0
186	TRUMP	I have a good energy with him.	0
187	TRUMP	I have a good chemistry with him.	0
188	TRUMP	Look at the horrible threats that were made.	0
189	TRUMP	No more threats.	0
190	TRUMP	No more threats.	0
191	LESLEY STAHL	China.	0
192	TRUMP	I get along with him.	0
193	TRUMP	It's very important.	0
194	TRUMP	China, let's go.	0
195	LESLEY STAHL	I'm skipping across the world here.	0
196	LESLEY STAHL	You've slapped a lot of tariffs--	0
197	TRUMP	$250 billion.	0
198	LESLEY STAHL	Gonna do more?	0
199	TRUMP	Might.	0
200	TRUMP	Might.	0
201	LESLEY STAHL	Round three?	0
202	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate, Lesley.	0
203	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate.	0
204	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready?	0
205	TRUMP	Look.	0
206	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready to--	0
207	TRUMP	I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.	0
208	TRUMP	I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.	0
209	TRUMP	I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.	1
210	LESLEY STAHL	And how-- how--	0
211	TRUMP	And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.	0
212	LESLEY STAHL	How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?	0
213	TRUMP	Okay.	0
214	TRUMP	Okay.	0
215	TRUMP	So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.	0
216	LESLEY STAHL	Some--	0
217	TRUMP	--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%.	0
218	LESLEY STAHL	But they've--	0
219	TRUMP	--again.	0
220	LESLEY STAHL	--retaliated.	0
221	LESLEY STAHL	That's what I'm asking.	0
222	TRUMP	They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate.	0
223	TRUMP	We do $100 billion with them.	0
224	TRUMP	They do $531 billion with us.	0
225	LESLEY STAHL	Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?	0
226	TRUMP	No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.	0
227	LESLEY STAHL	Well that's what I'm asking.	0
228	TRUMP	I don't want that.	0
229	TRUMP	No, I don't want that.	0
230	TRUMP	I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.	0
231	TRUMP	I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.	0
232	LESLEY STAHL	But you're in a--	0
233	TRUMP	And it will be a fair deal--	0
234	LESLEY STAHL	--trade war right now.	0
235	LESLEY STAHL	Trade war.	0
236	TRUMP	You call it war, I don't call--	0
237	LESLEY STAHL	You-- you--	0
238	TRUMP	--it--	0
239	LESLEY STAHL	--you did today.	0
240	TRUMP	I called it a skirmish.	0
241	LESLEY STAHL	I heard you, you called it a war.	0
242	TRUMP	I called it, actually I called it a battle.	0
243	TRUMP	But, actually, I'm gonna lower that.	0
244	TRUMP	I consider it a skirmish.	0
245	TRUMP	And we're gonna win.	0
246	LESLEY STAHL	You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.	0
247	TRUMP	I mean, what's an ally?	0
248	TRUMP	We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.	0
249	TRUMP	But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.	0
250	TRUMP	The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.	0
251	LESLEY STAHL	But this is hostile.	0
252	TRUMP	And yet, they-- it's not hostile.	0
253	LESLEY STAHL	It sounds hostile.	0
254	TRUMP	You know what's hostile?	0
255	TRUMP	The way they treat us.	0
256	TRUMP	We're not hostile.	0
257	LESLEY STAHL	No, but can't you deal with--	0
258	TRUMP	We've been-- we've been--	0
259	LESLEY STAHL	--them without--	0
260	TRUMP	--the stupid country for so many years.	0
261	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?	0
262	TRUMP	Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine.	0
263	TRUMP	But you know what?	0
264	TRUMP	We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.	1
265	TRUMP	And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade.	0
266	TRUMP	They're not going to do it anymore.	0
267	TRUMP	They understand that.	0
268	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?	0
269	LESLEY STAHL	It's been going for 70 years.	0
270	LESLEY STAHL	It's kept the peace for 70 years.	0
271	TRUMP	You don't know that.	0
272	TRUMP	You don't know that.	0
273	LESLEY STAHL	I don't know what?	0
274	TRUMP	You don't know that.	0
275	LESLEY STAHL	Is it true General Mattis said to you, "The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"	0
276	TRUMP	No, it's not true.	0
277	LESLEY STAHL	What's not true?	0
278	TRUMP	Frankly, I like General Mattis.	0
279	TRUMP	I think I know more about it than he does.	0
280	TRUMP	And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.	0
281	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna try one more time.	0
282	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.	0
283	TRUMP	I know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again.	0
284	TRUMP	I know exactly what you're saying--	0
285	LESLEY STAHL	Well, answer my question.	0
286	TRUMP	The answer is this.	0
287	TRUMP	I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way.	0
288	TRUMP	I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.	0
289	LESLEY STAHL	Putin.	0
290	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
291	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.	0
292	TRUMP	Okay, you ready?	0
293	LESLEY STAHL	I don't understand it.	0
294	TRUMP	I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--	0
295	LESLEY STAHL	No, I mean publicly.	0
296	LESLEY STAHL	You never say anything harsh about him--	0
297	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
298	LESLEY STAHL	--publicly.	0
299	TRUMP	I didn't?	0
300	TRUMP	I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.	1
301	TRUMP	Obama didn't.	0
302	TRUMP	You know what he sent?	0
303	TRUMP	He sent pillows and blankets.	0
304	TRUMP	I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--	0
305	LESLEY STAHL	Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--	0
306	TRUMP	I think I'm very tough with him personally.	0
307	TRUMP	I had a meeting with him.	0
308	TRUMP	The two of us.	0
309	TRUMP	It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.	0
310	LESLEY STAHL	Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?	0
311	LESLEY STAHL	In poisonings?	0
312	TRUMP	Probably he is, yeah.	0
313	TRUMP	Probably.	0
314	TRUMP	I mean, I don't--	0
315	LESLEY STAHL	Probably?	0
316	TRUMP	But I rely on them, it's not in our country.	0
317	LESLEY STAHL	Why not-- they shouldn't do it.	0
318	LESLEY STAHL	This is a terrible thing.	0
319	TRUMP	Of course they shouldn't do it-	0
320	LESLEY STAHL	Instead do you believe--	0
321	TRUMP	That's your (Inaudible.)--	0
322	LESLEY STAHL	--do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?	0
323	LESLEY STAHL	Our election-	0
324	TRUMP	They-- they meddled.	0
325	TRUMP	But I think China meddled too.	0
326	LESLEY STAHL	But why do you--	0
327	TRUMP	And I think other countries--	0
328	LESLEY STAHL	--say China meddled too?	0
329	TRUMP	And you wanna know something?	0
330	LESLEY STAHL	Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--	0
331	TRUMP	Well, let me ask you--	0
332	LESLEY STAHL	--the Russians meddled?	0
333	TRUMP	Because I think China meddled also.	0
334	TRUMP	And I think, frankly, China--	0
335	LESLEY STAHL	This is amazing.	0
336	TRUMP	--is a bigger problem.	0
337	LESLEY STAHL	You are diverting the whole Russia thing.	0
338	TRUMP	I'm not doing anything.	0
339	LESLEY STAHL	You are, you are	0
340	TRUMP	I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.	0
341	LESLEY STAHL	What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?	0
342	TRUMP	Well, we'll see what happens come midterms.	0
343	TRUMP	But--	0
344	LESLEY STAHL	But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--	0
345	TRUMP	I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.	0
346	TRUMP	I was very disappointed.	0
347	TRUMP	Why should he have recused himself?	0
348	TRUMP	So I was very--	0
349	LESLEY STAHL	So--	0
350	TRUMP	--disappointed but--	0
351	LESLEY STAHL	So can I assume--	0
352	TRUMP	--we'll see what happens.	0
353	LESLEY STAHL	Can I assume he's gone?	0
354	TRUMP	No.	0
355	TRUMP	No.	0
356	TRUMP	You can't assume that.	0
357	LESLEY STAHL	Will you.	0
358	LESLEY STAHL	Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?	0
359	TRUMP	Well, I-- I don't pledge anything.	0
360	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.	0
361	TRUMP	I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.	0
362	LESLEY STAHL	But you won't pledge--	0
363	TRUMP	There is no collusion.	0
364	TRUMP	I don't wanna pledge.	0
365	TRUMP	Why should I pledge to you?	0
366	TRUMP	If I pledge, I'll pledge.	0
367	TRUMP	I don't have to pledge to you.	0
368	TRUMP	But I have-	0
369	LESLEY STAHL	Well--	0
370	TRUMP	I have no intention of doing that.	0
371	TRUMP	Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?	1
372	TRUMP	Give me a break.	0
373	TRUMP	They wouldn't be able to help me at all.	1
374	TRUMP	Call Russia.	0
375	TRUMP	It's so ridiculous.	0
376	LESLEY STAHL	So you've been president for almost two years.	0
377	LESLEY STAHL	Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?	0
378	LESLEY STAHL	Do you have any regrets?	0
379	TRUMP	So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly.	0
380	TRUMP	I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great.	0
381	TRUMP	Lesley, they treat me worse.	0
382	TRUMP	They got worse instead of better.	0
383	TRUMP	Very dishonest.	0
384	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?	0
385	TRUMP	I regret that the press treats me so badly--	0
386	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--	0
387	TRUMP	And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.	0
388	LESLEY STAHL	Have you made any mistakes?	0
389	LESLEY STAHL	That's my question.	0
390	TRUMP	Everybody makes mistakes.	0
391	LESLEY STAHL	And what have been yours?	0
392	TRUMP	I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.	0
393	TRUMP	The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders.	0
394	TRUMP	I was getting to know countries.	0
395	TRUMP	I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.	0
396	TRUMP	So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.	0
397	LESLEY STAHL	What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--	1
398	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
399	TRUMP	Well, that was--	0
400	LESLEY STAHL	from the--	0
401	TRUMP	the same as the Obama law.	1
402	TRUMP	You know, Obama had the same thing.	1
403	LESLEY STAHL	It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it.	0
404	LESLEY STAHL	You--enforced it.	0
405	LESLEY STAHL	You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--	0
406	TRUMP	No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation.	0
407	TRUMP	And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.	0
408	LESLEY STAHL	So are you gonna go back to that?	0
409	TRUMP	Well, we're looking at a lot of things.	0
410	TRUMP	Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world.	0
411	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.	0
412	TRUMP	No, I want all the laws changed.	0
413	LESLEY STAHL	But the children specifically--	0
414	TRUMP	there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally.	0
415	TRUMP	And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.	0
416	LESLEY STAHL	Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.	0
417	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
418	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?	0
419	LESLEY STAHL	You said, "We're looking at everything."	0
420	TRUMP	I will--	0
421	LESLEY STAHL	Yes or no.	0
422	TRUMP	I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.	0
423	TRUMP	What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.	0
424	LESLEY STAHL	I'm not gonna ask it again--	0
425	TRUMP	You don't have to.	0
426	LESLEY STAHL	cause I know you won't-- it--	0
427	TRUMP	But it's the same as Obama.	0
428	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.	0
429	LESLEY STAHL	Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military.	0
430	LESLEY STAHL	You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?	0
431	TRUMP	Okay.	0
432	TRUMP	So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah.	0
433	TRUMP	Now I say they're babies.	0
434	LESLEY STAHL	Who's the toughest?	0
435	TRUMP	They're babies, the political people.	0
436	TRUMP	This is the most deceptive, vicious world.	0
437	TRUMP	It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception.	0
438	TRUMP	You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.	0
439	LESLEY STAHL	Give me an example.	0
440	TRUMP	Well, I don't wanna give you an example.	0
441	TRUMP	I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do.	0
442	TRUMP	Remember that.	0
443	TRUMP	When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries.	0
444	TRUMP	Nobody's been able to do anything like this.	0
445	TRUMP	Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it.	0
446	TRUMP	But it's a very deceptive world.	0
447	TRUMP	The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.	0
448	TRUMP	I-- I-- and I really mean it.	0
449	TRUMP	I'm not saying that as a sound bite.	0
450	TRUMP	I never--	0
451	LESLEY STAHL	I'd like to--	0
452	TRUMP	Knew how dishonest--	0
453	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.	0
454	TRUMP	Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation.	0
455	TRUMP	When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.	0
456	LESLEY STAHL	No, I'm gonna run your--	0
457	TRUMP	When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.	0
458	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so.	0
459	TRUMP	I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.	0
460	LESLEY STAHL	I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you.	0
461	TRUMP	Hey, it's okay--	0
462	LESLEY STAHL	All right, I'll get in another fight with you--	0
463	TRUMP	Lesley, it's okay.	0
464	TRUMP	In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not.	0
465	LESLEY STAHL	This country is divided, polarized.	0
466	LESLEY STAHL	Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other.	0
467	LESLEY STAHL	What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--	0
468	TRUMP	Yeah-- I think that--	0
469	LESLEY STAHL	--anger?	0
470	TRUMP	--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.	0
471	TRUMP	It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama.	0
472	TRUMP	I can see the country uniting.	0
473	TRUMP	I can see it.	0
474	TRUMP	We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh-- you-- know what I'm saying.	0
475	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won that.	0
476	TRUMP	--during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.	0
477	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won, you won.	0
478	LESLEY STAHL	No-- no one is gonna argue with that.	0
479	TRUMP	I won--	0
480	LESLEY STAHL	You won.	0
481	LESLEY STAHL	And then after you won, instead of saying, "Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful.	0
482	LESLEY STAHL	Let's heal all of this," you come out and bash the Democrats.	0
483	TRUMP	Well, I bashed their attitude.	0
484	TRUMP	I bashed their statements--	0
485	LESLEY STAHL	But why not try to--	0
486	TRUMP	Because they were--	0
487	LESLEY STAHL	--bring us together?	0
488	TRUMP	--so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh.	0
489	TRUMP	I've never--	0
490	LESLEY STAHL	But why not--	0
491	TRUMP	seen anything like it.	0
492	LESLEY STAHL	--why not try and-- we need to be healed.	0
493	LESLEY STAHL	We need--	0
494	TRUMP	I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.	0
495	LESLEY STAHL	Well, you don't wanna--	0
496	TRUMP	I think--	0
497	LESLEY STAHL	heal yet.	0
498	TRUMP	I-- I-- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.	0
499	TRUMP	I don't think they wanna be healed.	0
500	TRUMP	I do wanna heal.	0
501	LESLEY STAHL	I'm n-- I'm not talking about Democrat-- I'm talking about the country.	0
502	LESLEY STAHL	You go out and you go to Mississippi.	0
503	TRUMP	The famous Mississippi speech?	0
504	LESLEY STAHL	And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.	0
505	LESLEY STAHL	You mimicked her.	0
506	TRUMP	Had I not made that speech, we would not have won.	0
507	TRUMP	I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.	0
508	LESLEY STAHL	No (Inaudible.)--	0
509	TRUMP	And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.	0
510	LESLEY STAHL	Why did you have to make fun of her?	0
511	TRUMP	I didn't really make fun of her.	0
512	LESLEY STAHL	Well, they were laughing.	0
513	TRUMP	What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.	0
514	LESLEY STAHL	Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and-- and was asked what's the worst moment.	0
515	LESLEY STAHL	And she said, "When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."	0
516	TRUMP	Ok, fine.	0
517	LESLEY STAHL	And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.	0
518	TRUMP	They can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this.	0
519	TRUMP	The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.	0
520	TRUMP	Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?	0
521	LESLEY STAHL	But did you have to--	0
522	TRUMP	Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll-- I'll--	0
523	LESLEY STAHL	And-- but--	0
524	TRUMP	be honest with you.	0
525	LESLEY STAHL	but do you think—you treated her with--	0
526	TRUMP	There are those that think she shouldn't have--	0
527	LESLEY STAHL	Do you think you treated her with respect?	0
528	TRUMP	I think so, yeah.	0
529	TRUMP	I did.	0
530	LESLEY STAHL	But you seem to be saying that she lied.	0
531	TRUMP	W-- you know what?	0
532	TRUMP	I'm not gonna get into it because we won.	0
533	TRUMP	It doesn't matter.	0
534	TRUMP	We won.	0
535	LESLEY STAHL	The anonymous column that ran in "The New York Times."	0
536	LESLEY STAHL	The author, we don't know who it is.	0
537	LESLEY STAHL	Whoever it is.	0
538	TRUMP	Whoever it is.	0
539	TRUMP	Maybe it was "The New York Times" too.	0
540	LESLEY STAHL	Paints a picture.	0
541	TRUMP	No, no, it's --By the way, you don't know how dishonest "The New York Times" is.	0
542	TRUMP	It could've been "The New York Times."	0
543	TRUMP	I doubt it.	0
544	TRUMP	But it could've been.	0
545	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.	0
546	LESLEY STAHL	I doubt it too.	0
547	TRUMP	It also could've been any-- w-- well, don't count on it.	0
548	TRUMP	It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.	0
549	LESLEY STAHL	You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine.	0
550	LESLEY STAHL	And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos.	0
551	TRUMP	It's-- wrong, it's so false.	0
552	TRUMP	It's fake news.	0
553	TRUMP	I'm changing things around.	0
554	TRUMP	And I'm entitled to.	0
555	TRUMP	I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal.	0
556	TRUMP	They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal.	0
557	LESLEY STAHL	More people gonna go?	0
558	TRUMP	Yeah, other people will go, sure.	0
559	LESLEY STAHL	Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of --on turnover.	0
560	TRUMP	I think I have a great Cabinet.	0
561	TRUMP	There're some people that I'm not happy with.	0
562	LESLEY STAHL	Who are you not happy with?	0
563	TRUMP	No, I don't wanna say that but	0
564	LESLEY STAHL	Come on.	0
565	TRUMP	Not I don't want to say that.	0
566	LESLEY STAHL	What about General Mattis?	0
567	LESLEY STAHL	Is he going to leave?	0
568	TRUMP	Well, I don't know.	0
569	TRUMP	He hasn't told me that.	0
570	TRUMP	I have--	0
571	LESLEY STAHL	Do you want him to--	0
572	TRUMP	--a very good relationship with him.	0
573	TRUMP	It could be that he is.	0
574	TRUMP	I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth.	0
575	TRUMP	But General Mattis is a good guy.	0
576	TRUMP	We get along very well.	0
577	TRUMP	He may leave.	0
578	TRUMP	I mean, at some point, everybody leaves.	0
579	TRUMP	Everybody.	0
580	TRUMP	People leave.	0
581	TRUMP	That's Washington.	0
582	LESLEY STAHL	The first lady, Melania.	0
583	LESLEY STAHL	She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.	0
584	TRUMP	I feel the same way.	0
585	TRUMP	I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.	0
586	LESLEY STAHL	You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, "Is he wearing a wire--"	0
587	TRUMP	I'm usually --	0
588	LESLEY STAHL	–or whatever?	0
589	TRUMP	Not so much a wire.	0
590	TRUMP	I'm usually guarded.	0
591	TRUMP	And I think I'm guarded anyway.	0
592	TRUMP	But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House.	0
593	TRUMP	I'm not a baby.	0
594	TRUMP	It's a tough business.	0
595	TRUMP	This is a r-- this is a vicious place.	0
596	TRUMP	Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place.	0
597	TRUMP	The attacks, the-- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back.	0
598	TRUMP	--but-- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.	0
599	LESLEY STAHL	It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.	0
600	TRUMP	I think so.	0
601	TRUMP	I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.	0
602	LESLEY STAHL	POTUS.	0
603	TRUMP	Now I very much feel like POTUS.	0
604	TRUMP	I do.	0
605	TRUMP	I feel like the president.	0
606	TRUMP	You know, for a little while, it's like-- "Mr. President, sir."	0
607	TRUMP	It's-- even my friends, they call me, they-- they don't call me Donald-- they call me Mr. President.	0
608	TRUMP	And I say, "Will you please loosen up?"	0
609	TRUMP	I've learned on the job.	0
610	TRUMP	I have.	0
611	LESLEY STAHL	And you feel comfortable?	0
612	TRUMP	I feel very comfortable, yeah.	0
