1	Bill O'Reilly	Caution, you are about to enter the No Spin Zone, THE FACTOR begins right now.	0
2	Bill O'Reilly	Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly.	0
3	Bill O'Reilly	Thanks for watching us tonight.	0
4	Bill O'Reilly	As you may know, my interview with President Trump making headlines all over the world.	0
5	Bill O'Reilly	And tonight, we will show you what you did not see in the Super Bowl pregame show.	0
6	Bill O'Reilly	Here is what happened.	0
7	Bill O'Reilly	We interviewed the President on Friday afternoon, at the White House.	0
8	Bill O'Reilly	The interview ran about 40 minutes.	0
9	Bill O'Reilly	Ten of which were used by FOX Sports.	0
10	Bill O'Reilly	So, that leaves us with half an hour.	0
11	Bill O'Reilly	To show you tonight and tomorrow.	0
12	Bill O'Reilly	The headlines out of the Super Bowl interview where Mr. Trump comments on the Russian and Putin and the anti-ObamaCare roll-up.	0
13	Bill O'Reilly	It's interesting to watch our two competing cable news stations, which hate, hate Mr. Trump to an unhealthy degree.	0
14	Bill O'Reilly	Try to analyze what the President told me.	0
15	Bill O'Reilly	I thought Donald Trump was straightforward and honest in that interview, whether you like his answers or not.	0
16	Bill O'Reilly	But the Trump haters were trying desperately to find something with which to hammer the President.	0
17	Bill O'Reilly	Also apparently the Putin administration in Moscow demanding that I, your humble correspondent, apologized for saying old blood is a killer.	0
18	Bill O'Reilly	So, I am working on that apology, but it may take a little time.	0
19	Bill O'Reilly	Might want to check in with me around 2023.	0
20	Bill O'Reilly	In a conference call with reporters, Putin's press guy said this.	0

23	Bill O'Reilly	We think words like that coming from the FOX correspondent are unacceptable, offensive, and to be honest, we would prefer to get an apology to the President coming from such a respected company.	0
24	SYSTEM	[End Video Clip]	0
25	Bill O'Reilly	Anyway, tonight, we have a number of subjects that we presented to President Trump.	0
26	Bill O'Reilly	Here they are.	0
27	SYSTEM	[Begin Video Clip]	0
28	Bill O'Reilly	Let's talk about Iran, your assessment, do you think we are on a collision course we being the United States with that country?	0
29	Donald Trump	I think it was the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.	0
30	Donald Trump	I think it was deal that should have never been negotiated.	0
31	Bill O'Reilly	The nuclear deal?	0
32	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
33	Donald Trump	The deal that was made by the Obama administration, I think it's a shame that we've had a deal like that and that we had to sign a deal like that and there was no reason to do it.	0
34	Donald Trump	And if you're going to do it have a good deal.	0
35	Donald Trump	Secretary Kerry who was negotiating it never once left the table.	0
36	Donald Trump	We have the worst of everything.	0
37	Donald Trump	We've already given them billions and billions, probably hundred $50 billion.	0
38	Donald Trump	We gave them $1.7 billion in cash, which is unheard of.	1
39	Donald Trump	And we put the money out.	0
40	Donald Trump	And we have really nothing to show for it.	0
41	Bill O'Reilly	Possibly you'll tear it up?	0
42	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.	0
43	Donald Trump	And we'll going to see what happens.	0
44	Donald Trump	I can say this, they had total disregard for our country.	0
45	Donald Trump	They are the number one terrorist state, they're sending money all over the place and weapons, and can't do that.	0
46	Bill O'Reilly	Sanctions, that's how you're going to start with them?	0
47	Donald Trump	Just started.	0
48	Bill O'Reilly	But you're going to move in a carrier, right?	0
49	Donald Trump	Well, we're just started with sanctions.	0
50	Donald Trump	I never talked about military moves.	0
51	Donald Trump	I always criticize President Obama with having an announcement that they're going into Mosul, they're going to some place.	0
52	Donald Trump	And they give the name, the date, the time.	0
53	Donald Trump	I don't believe in that.	0
54	Donald Trump	We will -- let's see what happens.	0
55	Donald Trump	But I don't like to talk about what we do militarily.	0
56	Bill O'Reilly	So, you're not real bullish on Iran at this point.	0
57	Donald Trump	No, I'm not bullish.	0
58	Donald Trump	It's like they're emboldened.	0
59	Donald Trump	They follow our planes, they circle our ships with their little boats, and they scream things at us.	0
60	Donald Trump	It is what happened -- it's not good.	0
61	Donald Trump	You would thought what the deal they made, which was a great deal for them and a horrible deal for us, that they would have had a warmth toward our country, and it's exactly the opposite.	0
62	Donald Trump	They lost respect because they can't believe anybody could be so stupid as to make a deal like that.	0
63	Bill O'Reilly	Let's talk about Mexico.	0
64	Bill O'Reilly	There was a report that you talk to President Nieto, and you told him that this was the report.	0
65	Bill O'Reilly	I want to know if it's true or not.	0
66	Bill O'Reilly	That if his arm he couldn't handle the drug cartels, that U.S. army soldiers would.	0
67	Bill O'Reilly	Did you say that?	0
68	Donald Trump	We have to do something about the cartels, I did talk to him about it.	0
69	Donald Trump	I want to help him with it.	0
70	Donald Trump	I think he is a very good man.	0
71	Donald Trump	We have a very good relationship, as you probably know.	0
72	Donald Trump	We will going to have a wall, we will going to have a border.	0
73	Donald Trump	We have to stop drugs from coming into our country, and if he can handle it, and maybe they can and maybe they can't or maybe he needs help, he seemed very willing to get help from us because he has got a problem and it's a real problem for us.	0
74	Bill O'Reilly	So, President Nieto of Mexico was open to the possibility of U.S. forces, all right?	0
75	Bill O'Reilly	Helping him combat the drug cartels.	0
76	Donald Trump	I would rather, as a very nice man that he is and somebody I respect, I would rather have him respond to that.	0
77	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, I certainly offered him help on knocking out the drug cartels because we have got a problem.	0
78	Donald Trump	Don't forget those cartels are operating in our country, and they are poisoning the youth of our country.	0
79	Donald Trump	And by the way, countries all over the work, just so you understand, this is a cartel all over the world, the cartels.	0
80	Donald Trump	But I certainly would help him if he needed the help here	0
81	Bill O'Reilly	At this point, do you consider Mexico a corrupt country?	0
82	Bill O'Reilly	Because this stuff has been going on for decades.	0
83	Bill O'Reilly	His Mexico corrupt.	0
84	Donald Trump	Well, it's a country that has got difficulty.	0
85	Donald Trump	It's certainly has done well with us.	0
86	Donald Trump	We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $60 billion a year.	0
87	Donald Trump	That doesn't include drugs, and it doesn't include the border and all the things that are happening on the border.	0
88	Donald Trump	But it is a country that I have great respect for the people.	0
89	Donald Trump	I love the people.	0
90	Donald Trump	I really like this administration.	0
91	Donald Trump	I think he is a good man.	0
92	Donald Trump	We get along very well.	0
93	Donald Trump	But they have problems controlling aspects of their country.	0
94	Donald Trump	There is no question about it.	0
95	Donald Trump	And I would say that drugs and the drug cartels number one.	0
96	Bill O'Reilly	Have you figured out what kind of a tariff you're going to levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?	0
97	Donald Trump	Well, we might not have to do that.	0
98	Donald Trump	They want to negotiate a deal.	0
99	Donald Trump	I want to negotiate a deal.	0
100	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.	0
101	Donald Trump	But we can always do a tariff or a tax if necessary, and we will do that if necessary.	0
102	Donald Trump	But if we can make a deal, we assignment of NAFTA, but I am going to put another F in the name NAFTA because right now it's free trade, and I'm going to have it fair trade also because it's not fair.	0
103	Bill O'Reilly	All right.	0
104	Bill O'Reilly	So --	0
105	Donald Trump	We are losing, Bill.	0
106	Donald Trump	We are losing $60 billion a year in trade deficits with Mexico.	0
107	Donald Trump	We can't do that.	0
108	Bill O'Reilly	You talked to Putin last week.	0
109	Bill O'Reilly	You had a busy week last week.	0
110	Donald Trump	I had a busy week.	0
111	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
112	Donald Trump	Busy week and a half.	0
113	Bill O'Reilly	But within 24 hours of you on the phone with the Russian leader, the pro-Russian forces step up the violence in Ukraine.	0
114	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
115	Bill O'Reilly	Did you take that as an insult?	0
116	Donald Trump	No I didn't because we don't really know exactly what that is.	0
117	Donald Trump	They're pro-forces.	0
118	Donald Trump	We don't know if they're uncontrollable?	0
119	Donald Trump	Are they uncontrollable?	0
120	Donald Trump	That happens also.	0
121	Donald Trump	We're going to find out.	0
122	Donald Trump	I will be surprised, but we will see.	0
123	Bill O'Reilly	Do you respect Putin?	0
124	Donald Trump	I do respect him.	0
125	Bill O'Reilly	Do you?	0
126	Bill O'Reilly	Why?	0
127	Donald Trump	Well, I respect a lot of people.	0
128	Donald Trump	But that doesn't mean I am going to get along with him.	0
129	Donald Trump	He's a leader of his country.	0
130	Donald Trump	I say it's better to get along with Russia than not.	0
131	Donald Trump	Will I get along with them?	0
132	Donald Trump	I have no idea.	0
133	Bill O'Reilly	He is a killer though.	0
134	Bill O'Reilly	Put is a killer.	0
135	Donald Trump	There are a lot of killers.	0
136	Donald Trump	Do you think our country is so innocent?	0
137	Donald Trump	Do you think our country is so innocent?	0
138	Bill O'Reilly	I don't know of any government leaders that are killers in America.	0
139	Donald Trump	Take a look at what we have done too.	0
140	Donald Trump	We've made a lot of mistakes.	0
141	Donald Trump	I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.	1
142	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.	0
143	Bill O'Reilly	Mistakes are different then --	0
144	Donald Trump	A lot of mistakes, okay?	0
145	Donald Trump	But a lot of people were killed.	0
146	Donald Trump	So, a lot of killers around, believe me.	0
147	Bill O'Reilly	All right.	0
148	Bill O'Reilly	You mentioned ISIS.	0
149	Bill O'Reilly	Can we expect, we the American people, more U.S. military action against ISIS?	0
150	Donald Trump	You know, I hate to be evasive but --	0
151	Bill O'Reilly	You know, tell me specifically.	0
152	Donald Trump	I don't like talking openly about it.	0
153	Donald Trump	I don't like talking openly about it.	0
154	Donald Trump	I can say this, ISIS is bad.	0
155	Donald Trump	They are evil.	0
156	Donald Trump	They cut off heads of Christians and Muslims and anybody else that gets in their way.	0
157	Donald Trump	They drown people in steel cages.	0
158	Donald Trump	This is like not since the medieval times has anything happened like this.	0
159	Donald Trump	And the previous administration allowed it to happen because we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.	0
160	Donald Trump	It created a vacuum, ISIS was formed.	0
161	Donald Trump	I was to take the oil.	0
162	Donald Trump	If they would've taken the oil, there would be no ISIS because they used that to --	0
163	Bill O'Reilly	If you took the oil, the Iraqi oil, you would have to put in U.S. troops to do that, and then that would have started another round of it.	0
164	Donald Trump	And you would have made a lot of money with the oil and you would have had assets and to the -- and all of that.	0
165	Donald Trump	But forget that.	0
166	Bill O'Reilly	Okay.	0
167	Bill O'Reilly	Let's turn to domestic policy.	0
168	Bill O'Reilly	When can Americans expect the tax cuts?	0
169	Bill O'Reilly	This year?	0
170	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
171	Donald Trump	We are working very much right now on the health care package.	0
172	Donald Trump	Which I think would be -- it is moving along very well.	0
173	Donald Trump	We are trying to get our person Dr. Tom price approved, as you know, the Democrats are being purely political reasons.	0
174	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.	0
175	Donald Trump	That is terrible.	0
176	Bill O'Reilly	But let me get you on the record here.	0
177	Bill O'Reilly	2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?	0
178	Donald Trump	I think so, yes.	0
179	Donald Trump	And I think before the end of the year, I would like to say yes.	0
180	Bill O'Reilly	Okay.	0
181	Bill O'Reilly	Can Americans in 2017 expect a new health care plan ruled out by the Trump administration?	0
182	Bill O'Reilly	This year.	0
183	Donald Trump	Well, in the process, and maybe it will take until sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process.	0
184	Donald Trump	Very complicated.	0
185	Donald Trump	ObamaCare is a disaster.	1
186	Donald Trump	You have to remember, ObamaCare doesn't work.	1
187	Donald Trump	You look at Arizona, 160 percent increase.	0
188	Donald Trump	You look at Minnesota, all of these places it's going through the roof.	0
189	Bill O'Reilly	It's done.	0
190	Donald Trump	It doesn't work.	0
191	Bill O'Reilly	But when are you going to have something ready?	0
192	Donald Trump	We're going to be putting it in very soon.	0
193	Donald Trump	I think that yes, I would like to say by the end of the year.	0
194	Donald Trump	At least the rudiments, but we should have something within a year into the following year.	0
195	Donald Trump	And by the way, we will have something that is good.	0
196	Donald Trump	Less expensive and really great health care.	0

206	Bill O'Reilly	Now, this is a fascinating story.	0
207	Bill O'Reilly	I just spent the week in California, as you know.	0
208	Bill O'Reilly	They are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state.	0
209	Bill O'Reilly	So, the state of California, led by Governor Jerry Brown is defying you, absolutely defying the President of the United States.	0
210	Bill O'Reilly	So, California and the USA are on a collision course.	0
211	Bill O'Reilly	How do you see it?	0
212	Donald Trump	Well, I think it is a ridiculous sanctuary cities as you know.	0
213	Donald Trump	I am very much opposed to sanctuary cities.	0
214	Donald Trump	They break crime, there are lots of problems.	0
215	Donald Trump	You do it very well with Kate and all of the other people you talk about on the show that I watch.	0
216	Donald Trump	I will tell you that sanctuary cities are -- they got a lot of problems, and if there is tremendous crime.	1
217	Donald Trump	A lot of people agree with me.	0
218	Donald Trump	This was a campaign issue.	0
219	Donald Trump	This isn't just brought up now.	0
220	Donald Trump	California in many ways is out of control, as you know.	0
221	Donald Trump	And from an economic standpoint, people are leaving California and going to Texas and other places that run in a different manner, but we will see what happens.	0
222	Donald Trump	We will certainly not stand for sanctuary even cities, let alone states.	0
223	Bill O'Reilly	You mentioned Kate's Law.	0
224	Bill O'Reilly	Why do you think the Democratic Party opposes Kate's Law?	0
225	Bill O'Reilly	It seems so logical.	0
226	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
227	Donald Trump	It's so logical.	0
228	Donald Trump	There are many things that are very logical, the tax cuts are logical but the Democrats who want to raise taxes --	0
229	Bill O'Reilly	But you didn't answer my question.	0
230	Bill O'Reilly	Why do the Democrats oppose, oppose, protecting Americans from violent foreign criminals?	0
231	Bill O'Reilly	Why?	0
232	Donald Trump	Because they think that is their voter.	0
233	Bill O'Reilly	You know what is fascinating, to watch you at the inauguration with Barack Obama.	0
234	Bill O'Reilly	You guys seem to get along.	0
235	Bill O'Reilly	All right?	0
236	Bill O'Reilly	Would that be accurate?	0
237	Donald Trump	It's a very strange phenomenon.	0
238	Donald Trump	We get along.	0
239	Donald Trump	I don't know if he will admit this, but he likes me.	0
240	Bill O'Reilly	How do you know he likes you?	0
241	Donald Trump	I like him because I can feel it.	0
242	Donald Trump	You know, that is what I do in life, it's called like, I understand.	0
243	Donald Trump	Now, we had a rough campaign.	0
244	Donald Trump	He was fighting better for Hillary than she did.	0
245	Donald Trump	He was vicious during the campaign toward me, and I was vicious toward him.	0
246	Donald Trump	We said horrible things about each other.	0
247	Donald Trump	And then we hopped into the car and we drive down Pennsylvania Avenue together.	0
248	Donald Trump	We don't even talk about it.	0
249	Donald Trump	Politics is amazing.	0
250	Bill O'Reilly	What did you talk about?	0
251	Donald Trump	We talked about the country.	0
252	Donald Trump	We talked about the future of the country.	0
253	Donald Trump	I asked him about what you think our biggest problem is, and he told me that I can't tell you, but it's a problem.	0
254	Donald Trump	It's a military problem.	0
255	Bill O'Reilly	China?	0
256	Donald Trump	No, it's not China.	0
257	Bill O'Reilly	No?	0
258	Donald Trump	No, it is, he did mention -- because I did ask him, I said, what would you say one, two, three problems are?	0
259	Donald Trump	And the number one problem that he felt I was a little bit surprised but I fully understand --	0
260	Bill O'Reilly	But you can't tell us?	0
261	Donald Trump	I can't do that.	0
262	Donald Trump	I can't do that.	0
263	Donald Trump	Not for any other reason other than I don't think he would mind if I said it.	0
264	Donald Trump	I don't want to let that particular place know that that's the way he or I feel.	0
265	Donald Trump	But we had a great -- it was a great inauguration.	0
266	Donald Trump	I loved every minute of it, and I got along with him.	0
267	Donald Trump	In fact, people were sort of surprised.	0
268	Donald Trump	I finished, I turned around, he was smiling, I was smiling.	0
269	Bill O'Reilly	It was fascinating.	0
270	Bill O'Reilly	But here's what was more fascinating.	0
271	Bill O'Reilly	Right after you guys embraced, shook hands, all of that, you gave a speech.	0
272	Bill O'Reilly	But your speech excoriated him.	0
273	Bill O'Reilly	You basically took his administration apart, and he is sitting five feet away from you.	0
274	Bill O'Reilly	In your mind, did you say, how is he reacting to this speech?	0
275	Donald Trump	See, I am an honest person, the country has a very, very deep- seated problems.	0
276	Donald Trump	We have to do something about it.	0
277	Donald Trump	And if you noticed, when I finish my speech, I turned around, shook his hand --	0
278	Bill O'Reilly	Yes.	0
279	Bill O'Reilly	Absolutely.	0
280	Donald Trump	And he was very gracious.	0
281	Donald Trump	And smiling.	0
282	Bill O'Reilly	I don't know if he was happy with that.	0
283	Donald Trump	I don't know, but he seemed to be.	0
284	Donald Trump	But this isn't just a knock on him.	0
285	Donald Trump	We have been going down the wrong path for many years beyond him.	0

291	Bill O'Reilly	What is the most surprising thing for you about this job you have?	0
292	Bill O'Reilly	You come from the private sector, no political office, now, you are the President of United States.	0
293	Bill O'Reilly	What surprised you?	0
294	Donald Trump	I think the size, the magnitude of everything.	0
295	Donald Trump	So, I was a very big real estate person.	0
296	Donald Trump	I build a building for 500 million or $900 million.	0
297	Donald Trump	And here, you look at an airplane contract where you can save $600 million on 90 plans.	0
298	Donald Trump	I saved more than $600 million.	0
299	Donald Trump	I got involved in negotiation on a fighter jet, the F-35.	0
300	Donald Trump	And by the way, Lockheed Martin, a great company.	0
301	Donald Trump	But they weren't bringing their price up.	0
302	Donald Trump	I got involved, I saved more than $600 million.	0
303	Donald Trump	I was very proud of that.	0
304	Donald Trump	But the magnitude of -- you can do that at every level of government.	0
305	Donald Trump	My new thing is going to be Pharma because we pay too much with the largest drug purchaser in the world.	0
306	Donald Trump	And they don't negotiate.	0

308	Donald Trump	I'm working long hours.	0

319	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
320	Donald Trump	I know.	0
321	Donald Trump	I have never -- I collect, you know, fake news.	0
322	Donald Trump	Some of the networks and some of the papers -- the level of dishonesty, when they take a story that should be good, I know good from bad.	0
323	Bill O'Reilly	Sure.	0
324	Donald Trump	They take something that should be a good story, in fact, sometimes, I say, oh, this is going to be nice to read and say, whoa.	0
325	Donald Trump	And they will purposely totally change it.	0
326	Donald Trump	It is fake news.	0
327	Bill O'Reilly	Why are they doing that?	0
328	Donald Trump	Well, because I am on the other side of the equation.	0
329	Donald Trump	They did it to Reagan but not as much.	0
330	Bill O'Reilly	Why?	0
331	Bill O'Reilly	I don't understand.	0
332	Donald Trump	I just think that it is just the other side of the coin.	0
333	Donald Trump	You know, they called themselves progressive, which is a beautiful word.	0
334	Donald Trump	But it's not true.	0
335	Bill O'Reilly	Do you think they don't like you?	0
