1	Julie Pace	I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.	0
2	Donald Trump	Good.	0
3	Julie Pace	I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview. Did you see Aya	0
4	SYSTEM	[Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years]	0
5	Julie Pace	...	0
6	Julie Pace	Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?	0
7	Donald Trump	No, just -- you know, I asked the government to let her out...	0
8	Donald Trump	You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.	0
9	Julie Pace	How did you hear about this story?	0
10	Donald Trump	Many people, human rights people, are talking about it.	0
11	Donald Trump	It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her.	0
12	Donald Trump	You realize -- I mean, she was in a rough place. Did you have to strike a deal with	0
13	SYSTEM	[Abdel-Fattah]	0
14	Donald Trump	el-Sissi over this?	0
15	Donald Trump	No.	0
16	Donald Trump	No deal.	0
17	Donald Trump	He was here.	0
18	Donald Trump	He -- I said, "I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out."	0
19	Donald Trump	And as you know, she went through a trial.	0
20	Donald Trump	And anyway, she was let go.	0
21	Donald Trump	And not only she, it was a total of eight people... Yeah, it's funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with	0
22	SYSTEM	[Angela]	0
23	Donald Trump	Merkel.	0
24	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk	0
25	Julie Pace	Really?	0
26	Donald Trump	Chancellor Merkel.	0
27	Donald Trump	And I guess somebody shouted out, "Shake her hand, shake her hand," you know.	0
28	Donald Trump	But I never heard it.	0
29	Donald Trump	But I had already shaken her hand four times.	0
30	Donald Trump	You know, because we were together for a long time.	0
31	Julie Pace	Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?	0
32	Donald Trump	No.	0
33	Donald Trump	Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration.	0
34	Donald Trump	We had unbelievable chemistry.	0
35	Donald Trump	And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi...	0
36	Donald Trump	So it was a great thing to see that happen.	0
37	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?	0
38	Donald Trump	I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier.	0
39	Donald Trump	It's not very meaningful.	0
40	Donald Trump	I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here.	0
41	Donald Trump	I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown.	0
42	Donald Trump	Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now.	0
43	Donald Trump	I really liked him a lot.	0
44	Donald Trump	I think he liked me.	0
45	Donald Trump	We have a great chemistry together...	0
46	Donald Trump	I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders.	0
47	Donald Trump	Nobody's written that.	0
48	Donald Trump	In fact, they said, "Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely," because on NATO, I want them to pay up.	0
49	Donald Trump	But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up.	0
50	Donald Trump	In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, "Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up."	0
51	Donald Trump	He'll pay.	0
52	Julie Pace	Did he say that?	0
53	Julie Pace	In your meeting?	0
54	Julie Pace	Your private meeting?	0
55	Donald Trump	He's going to end up paying.	0
56	Donald Trump	But you know, nobody ever asked the question.	0
57	Donald Trump	Nobody asked.	0
58	Donald Trump	Nobody ever asked him to pay up.	0
59	Donald Trump	So it's a different kind of a presidency.	0
60	Julie Pace	Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?	0
61	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
62	Donald Trump	Let me give me an example.	0
63	Donald Trump	A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet.	0
64	Donald Trump	It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.	0
65	Donald Trump	It was seven years behind schedule.	0
66	Donald Trump	It was a disaster.	0
67	Donald Trump	So I called in Lockheed and I said, "I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing," or whoever else.	0
68	Donald Trump	But Boeing.	0
69	Donald Trump	And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...	0
70	Donald Trump	I saved $725 million on the 90 planes.	1
71	Donald Trump	Just 90.	0
72	Donald Trump	Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered.	0
73	Donald Trump	On 90 planes I saved $725 million.	0
74	Donald Trump	It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million.	0
75	Donald Trump	Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, "I've never seen anything like this in my life."	0
76	Donald Trump	We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut.	0
77	Donald Trump	And the reason they cut -- same planes, same everything -- was because of me.	0
78	Donald Trump	I mean, because that's what I do.	0
79	Donald Trump	Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes.	0
80	Donald Trump	In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those...	0
81	Donald Trump	The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, "Could I thank you?"	0
82	Donald Trump	I said, "What?"	0
83	Donald Trump	He said, "You saved us $100 million."	0
84	Donald Trump	Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought.	0
85	Donald Trump	Nobody wrote that story.	0
86	Donald Trump	Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of -- it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order.	0
87	Donald Trump	But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.	0
88	Julie Pace	And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?	0
89	Donald Trump	More.	0
90	Donald Trump	I'm gonna get more than that.	0
91	Donald Trump	This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn	0
92	SYSTEM	[Hewson]	0
93	Donald Trump	, she was great.	0
94	Donald Trump	But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing.	0
95	Donald Trump	You know?	0
96	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?	0
97	Donald Trump	I have great relationships with Congress.	0
98	Donald Trump	I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things.	0
99	Donald Trump	We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform.	0
100	Donald Trump	And it's -- we've worked on it long and hard.	0
101	Donald Trump	And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days.	0
102	Donald Trump	President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare.	0
103	Donald Trump	I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right?	0
104	Donald Trump	Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close.	0
105	Donald Trump	And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.	0
106	Julie Pace	Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at?	0
107	Donald Trump	So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people.	0
108	Donald Trump	They're great people.	0
109	Donald Trump	But some are moderate, some are very conservative.	0
110	Donald Trump	The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much.	0
111	Donald Trump	You know the Democrats have, they don't have that.	0
112	Donald Trump	The Republicans do have that.	0
113	Donald Trump	And I think it's fine.	0
114	Donald Trump	But you know there's a pretty vast area in there.	0
115	Donald Trump	And I have a great relationship with all of them.	0
116	Donald Trump	Now, we have government not closing.	0
117	Donald Trump	I think we'll be in great shape on that.	0
118	Donald Trump	It's going very well.	0
119	Donald Trump	Obviously, that takes precedent.	0
120	Julie Pace	That takes precedent over health care?	0
121	Julie Pace	For next week?	0
122	Donald Trump	Yeah, sure.	0
123	Donald Trump	Next week.	0
124	Donald Trump	Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier.	0
125	Donald Trump	The press keeps talking about the hundred days.	0
126	Donald Trump	But we've done a lot.	0
127	Donald Trump	You have a list of things.	0
128	Donald Trump	I don't have to read it.	0
129	Julie Pace	You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan.	0
130	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?	0
131	Donald Trump	Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan.	0
132	Donald Trump	But yeah.	0
133	Donald Trump	Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...	0
134	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
135	Donald Trump	But things change.	0
136	Donald Trump	There has to be flexibility.	0
137	Donald Trump	Let me give you an example.	0
138	Donald Trump	President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship.	0
139	Donald Trump	For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, "By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem," doesn't work.	0
140	Donald Trump	So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One.	0
141	Donald Trump	Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing.	0
142	Donald Trump	It's not like generalities.	0
143	Donald Trump	Do you want a Coke or anything?	0
144	Julie Pace	I'm OK, thank you.	0
145	Julie Pace	No...	0
146	Donald Trump	But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators.	0
147	Donald Trump	Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever.	0
148	Donald Trump	But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, "By the way, would you help us with North Korea?	0
149	Donald Trump	And also, you're a currency manipulator."	0
150	Donald Trump	It doesn't work that way.	0
151	Julie Pace	Right.	0
152	Donald Trump	And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness.	0
153	Donald Trump	But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it.	0
154	Donald Trump	You know because of a couple of them said, "He didn't call them a currency manipulator."	0
155	Donald Trump	Well, for two reasons.	0
156	Donald Trump	Number One, he's not, since my time.	0
157	Donald Trump	You know, very specific formula.	0
158	Donald Trump	You would think it's like generalities, it's not.	0
159	Donald Trump	They have -- they've actually -- their currency's gone up.	0
160	Donald Trump	So it's a very, very specific formula.	0
161	Donald Trump	And I said, "How badly have they been,"... they said, "Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency."	0
162	Donald Trump	That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.	0
163	Donald Trump	Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't.	0
164	Donald Trump	Can you imagine?	0
165	Donald Trump	...	0
166	Julie Pace	So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?	0
167	Donald Trump	No, because much of the foundation's been laid.	0
168	Donald Trump	Things came up.	0
169	Donald Trump	I'll give you an example.	0
170	Donald Trump	I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.	0
171	Julie Pace	I think it's on there.	0
172	Donald Trump	I don't know...	0
173	Julie Pace	Begin the process of selecting.	0
174	Julie Pace	You actually exceeded on this one.	0
175	Julie Pace	This says, "Begin the process of selecting a replacement."	0
176	Donald Trump	That's the biggest thing I've done.	0
177	Julie Pace	Do you consider that your biggest success?	0
178	Donald Trump	Well, I -- first of all I think he's a great man.	0
179	Donald Trump	I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court.	0
180	Donald Trump	I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do.	0
181	Donald Trump	Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years....	0
182	Donald Trump	He's a young man.	0
183	Donald Trump	I've always heard that that's the biggest thing.	0
184	Donald Trump	Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing.	0
185	Donald Trump	You know, to be honest, there are a number of things.	0
186	Donald Trump	But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.	0
187	Donald Trump	I've done one in my first 70 days.	0
188	Donald Trump	Our military is so proud.	0
189	Donald Trump	They were not proud at all.	0
190	Donald Trump	They had their heads down.	0
191	Donald Trump	Now they have their heads up...	0
192	Donald Trump	I'm rebuilding the military.	0
193	Donald Trump	We have great people.	0
194	Donald Trump	We have great things in place.	0
195	Donald Trump	We have tremendous borders.	0
196	Donald Trump	I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million -- look at that, that's a massive amount of money.	0
197	Donald Trump	And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes -- Gen. Mattis said, "I've never seen anything like this," because he had to sign the ultimate	0
198	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
199	Donald Trump	...	0
200	Donald Trump	He had to sign the ultimate, you know.	0
201	Donald Trump	He said, "I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military."	0
202	Donald Trump	You know, that kind of cutting.	0
203	Julie Pace	Right. Now, if I can do that	0
204	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
205	Julie Pace	... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget.	0
206	Donald Trump	That won't happen.	0
207	Julie Pace	Is that something you're going to take on?	0
208	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
209	Julie Pace	But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive...	0
210	Julie Pace	Can I ask you, over your first 100 days -- you're not quite there yet -- how do you feel like the office has changed you?	0
211	Donald Trump	Well the one thing I would say -- and I say this to people -- I never realized how big it was. Everything's so	0
212	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
213	Donald Trump	like, you know the orders are so massive.	0
214	Donald Trump	I was talking to --	0
215	Julie Pace	You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean --	0
216	Donald Trump	Number One, there's great responsibility.	0
217	Donald Trump	When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria.	0
218	Donald Trump	I'm saying to myself, "You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles.	0
219	Donald Trump	This is death that's involved," because people could have been killed.	0
220	Donald Trump	This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area -- you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away -- and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make.	0
221	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
222	Donald Trump	...	0
223	Donald Trump	This is involving death and life and so many things....	0
224	Donald Trump	So it's far more responsibility.	0
225	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
226	Donald Trump	....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency.	0
227	Donald Trump	This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world.	0
228	Donald Trump	The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department.	0
229	Donald Trump	The third-largest company in the world is Social Security.	0
230	Donald Trump	The fourth-largest -- you know, you go down the list.	0
231	Julie Pace	Right.	0
232	Donald Trump	It's massive.	0
233	Donald Trump	And every agency is, like, bigger than any company.	0
234	Donald Trump	So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility.	0
235	Donald Trump	And the human responsibility.	0
236	Donald Trump	You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions.	0
237	Julie Pace	You've talked a little bit about the way that you've brought some business skills into the office.	0
238	Julie Pace	Is there anything from your business background that just doesn't translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?	0
239	Donald Trump	Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people.	0
240	Donald Trump	So if you're talking about health care -- you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera.	0
241	Donald Trump	You're providing health. This is	0
242	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
243	Donald Trump	.	0
244	Donald Trump	Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.	0
245	Julie Pace	What's that switch been like for you?	0
246	Donald Trump	In fact, in business you're actually better off without it.	0
247	Julie Pace	What's making that switch been like for you?	0
248	Donald Trump	You have to love people.	0
249	Donald Trump	And if you love people, such a big responsibility.	0
250	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
251	Donald Trump	You can take any single thing, including even taxes.	0
252	Donald Trump	I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big	0
253	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
254	Donald Trump	.	0
255	Donald Trump	Everybody's saying, "Oh, he's delaying."	0
256	Donald Trump	I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is	0
257	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
258	Donald Trump	.	0
259	Donald Trump	I used to get great press.	0
260	Donald Trump	I get the worst press.	0
261	Donald Trump	I get such dishonest reporting with the media.	0
262	Donald Trump	That's another thing that really has -- I've never had anything like it before.	0
263	Donald Trump	It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, "Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press."	0
264	Donald Trump	And it got worse.	0
265	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
266	Donald Trump	So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me.	0
267	Donald Trump	I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.	0
268	Julie Pace	But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?	0
269	Donald Trump	Well I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform -- business and for people -- we want to do both. We've been working on it	0
270	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
271	Donald Trump	.	0
272	Donald Trump	Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful	0
273	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
274	Donald Trump	.... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case	0
275	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
276	Donald Trump	.... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.	0
277	Julie Pace	Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?	0
278	Donald Trump	Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut.	0
279	Donald Trump	It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.	0
280	Donald Trump	Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had...	0
281	Julie Pace	Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open.	0
282	Julie Pace	If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?	0
283	Donald Trump	I don't know yet.	0
284	Donald Trump	People want the border wall.	0
285	Donald Trump	My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it -- you've been to many of the rallies.	0
286	Donald Trump	OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall.	0
287	Donald Trump	My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent.	0
288	Donald Trump	You know, it's funny.	0
289	Donald Trump	The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college.	0
290	Donald Trump	Big, big, big advantage.	0
291	Donald Trump	I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college -- but it's a whole different campaign	0
292	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
293	Donald Trump	.	0
294	Donald Trump	The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it.	0
295	Donald Trump	They want to see the wall, they want to see security.	0
296	Donald Trump	Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down.... That's a tremendous achievement.... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower.	0
297	Donald Trump	Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime.	0
298	Donald Trump	You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that?	0
299	SYSTEM	[Unintelligible]	0
300	Donald Trump	Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through.	0
301	Julie Pace	It sounds like maybe you're beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn't have border funding in there, you would sign it.	0
302	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing.	0
303	Donald Trump	I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.	0
304	Julie Pace	What do you think the estimate on it would be?	0
305	Donald Trump	Oh I'm seeing numbers -- $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less.	0
306	Donald Trump	That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about.	0
307	Donald Trump	If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in -- and we'll stop all of it.	0
308	Donald Trump	But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall -- they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall.	0
309	Donald Trump	That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent.	0
310	Donald Trump	The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable.	0
311	Donald Trump	We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much.	0
312	Donald Trump	And most of it's coming from the southern border.	0
313	Donald Trump	The wall will stop the drugs.	0
314	Julie Pace	But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn't have --	0
315	Donald Trump	I don't want to comment.	0
316	Donald Trump	I just don't know yet.	0
317	Donald Trump	I mean, I have to see what's going on.	0
318	Donald Trump	I really do.	0
319	Donald Trump	But the wall's a very important thing to -- not only my base, but to the people.	0
320	Donald Trump	And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular....	0
321	Donald Trump	The wall is very important to stopping drugs.	0
322	Julie Pace	If you don't have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?	0
323	Donald Trump	My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK?	0
324	Donald Trump	One hundred percent.	0
325	Donald Trump	One hundred percent it's getting built.	0
326	Donald Trump	And it's also getting built for much less money -- I hope you get this -- than these people are estimating.	0
327	Donald Trump	The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall.	0
328	Donald Trump	It's not going to cost anywhere near that.	0
329	Julie Pace	You think $10 billion or less.	0
330	Donald Trump	I think $10 billion or less.	0
331	Donald Trump	And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more.	0
332	Donald Trump	But it's not going to be anywhere near those kind of numbers.	0
333	Donald Trump	And they're using those numbers; they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable.	0
334	Donald Trump	And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.	0
335	SYSTEM	[Interview goes off the record]	0
336	Donald Trump	They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete.	0
337	Donald Trump	But they didn't say why it was obsolete.	0
338	Donald Trump	I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government.	0
339	Donald Trump	People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right?	0
340	Donald Trump	So they asked me, Wolf... asked me about NATO, and I said two things.	0
341	Donald Trump	NATO's obsolete -- not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO -- NATO is obsolete, and I said, "And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism."	0
342	Donald Trump	You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.	0
343	Julie Pace	What specifically has NATO changed?	0
344	SYSTEM	[Citing Wall Street Journal Article]	0
345	Julie Pace	...	0
346	Donald Trump	I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete -- I said two things -- obsolete, and the country's aren't paying.	0
347	Donald Trump	I was right about both.	0
348	Donald Trump	I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO.	0
349	Donald Trump	I took heat like you wouldn't believe.	0
350	Donald Trump	And then some expert on NATO said, "You know, Trump is right."	0
351	Donald Trump	But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror...	0
352	Donald Trump	It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent.	0
353	Donald Trump	And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month."	0
354	Julie Pace	This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election.	0
355	Julie Pace	What did you mean by that?	0
356	Donald Trump	Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.	0
357	Julie Pace	Do you think it's going to help Marine Le Pen?	0
358	Donald Trump	I think so.	0
359	Julie Pace	Do you believe that she should be the president?	0
360	Donald Trump	No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.	0
361	Julie Pace	Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to --.	0
362	Donald Trump	No.	0
363	Donald Trump	Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win.	0
364	Donald Trump	I am no different than you, you could say the same thing...	0
365	Julie Pace	I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...	0
366	Donald Trump	No, I am no different than -- no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages.	0
367	Donald Trump	I think what we've done on the border discourages it.	0
368	Donald Trump	I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.	0
369	Donald Trump	I'm not going to have it in this country.	0
370	Donald Trump	I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here.	0
371	Donald Trump	And it's already largely, you know -- we have tens -- we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here.	0
372	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be here.	0
373	Donald Trump	We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever.	0
374	Donald Trump	They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country.	0
375	Donald Trump	It's a big mistake.	0
376	Julie Pace	Just so that I am clear.	0
377	Julie Pace	You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are --	0
378	Donald Trump	I am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.	0
379	Julie Pace	Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.	0
380	Donald Trump	I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election.	0
381	Donald Trump	I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know.	0
382	Donald Trump	Right now, she is in second place.	0
383	Julie Pace	I have a question on the markets, actually.	0
384	Julie Pace	One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress.	0
385	Julie Pace	Do you worry, though -- I mean, the markets go up and down.	0
386	Donald Trump	You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent.	0
387	Donald Trump	But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.	1
388	Donald Trump	Five hundred thousand.... As an example, Ford, General Motors.	0
389	Donald Trump	I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, "Only because of you am I making this massive investment."	0
390	Donald Trump	Intel, only because of you....	0
391	Donald Trump	The press never writes that.	0
392	Julie Pace	What about NAFTA?	0
393	Julie Pace	What's the plan on NAFTA?	0
394	Donald Trump	What would you like to know?	0
395	Julie Pace	I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.	0
396	Donald Trump	I am very upset with NAFTA.	0
397	Donald Trump	I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States.	0
398	Donald Trump	It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico.	0
399	Donald Trump	Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada.	0
400	Donald Trump	You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.	0
401	Julie Pace	Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?	0
402	Donald Trump	I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.	0
403	Julie Pace	Termination is still on the table.	0
404	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
405	Donald Trump	If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.	0
406	Julie Pace	What's a timeline for that decision?	0
407	Donald Trump	It's a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a six-month clause.	0
408	Julie Pace	If I could fit a couple of more topics.	0
409	Julie Pace	Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority.	0
410	Julie Pace	You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails.	0
411	Julie Pace	Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?	0
412	Donald Trump	When Wikileaks came out... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it.	1
413	Donald Trump	When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, "Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff."	0
414	Donald Trump	You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses.	0
415	Donald Trump	They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management.	0
416	Donald Trump	But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them.	0
417	Donald Trump	They weren't able to get through to Republicans.	0
418	Donald Trump	No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, "Wow."	0
419	Donald Trump	It was just a figure of speech.	0
420	Donald Trump	I said, "Well, look at this.	0
421	Donald Trump	It's good reading."	0
422	Julie Pace	But that didn't mean that you supported what Assange is doing?	0
423	Donald Trump	No, I don't support or unsupport.	0
424	Donald Trump	It was just information.	0
425	Donald Trump	They shouldn't have allowed it to get out.	0
426	Donald Trump	If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI.	0
427	Donald Trump	How about this -- they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server.	0
428	Donald Trump	But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't	0
429	SYSTEM	[John]	0
430	Donald Trump	Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server?	0
431	Donald Trump	They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.	0
432	Julie Pace	CrowdStrike?	0
433	Donald Trump	That's what I heard.	0
434	Donald Trump	I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard.	0
435	Donald Trump	But they brought in another company to investigate the server.	0
436	Donald Trump	Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server?	0
437	Donald Trump	I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about.	0
438	Donald Trump	It's incredible.	0
439	Julie Pace	Can I just ask you, though -- do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?	0
440	Donald Trump	I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me.	0
441	Donald Trump	I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.	0
442	Julie Pace	On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign --	0
443	Donald Trump	And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers...	0
444	Julie Pace	On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail.	0
445	Julie Pace	And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement.	0
446	Julie Pace	When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?	0
447	Donald Trump	In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.	0
448	Julie Pace	So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?	0
449	Donald Trump	No, I don't say that.	0
450	Donald Trump	I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement.	0
451	Donald Trump	There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.	0
452	Julie Pace	In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?	0
453	Donald Trump	In terms of what they are doing of all over.	0
454	Julie Pace	When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal?	0
455	Julie Pace	Do they want you to stay in that deal?	0
456	Donald Trump	I don't talk to them about it.	0
457	Julie Pace	You don't talk to them about the Iran deal?	0
458	Donald Trump	I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential.	0
459	Donald Trump	No, they have their own opinions.	0
460	Donald Trump	I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.	0
461	Julie Pace	At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?	0
462	Donald Trump	It's possible that we won't.	0
463	Julie Pace	Dreamers, you've talked about them, you've talked about heart earlier.	0
464	Julie Pace	This is one area where you have talked --	0
465	Donald Trump	No, we aren't looking to do anything right now.	0
466	Donald Trump	Look, the dreamers... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right?	0
467	Donald Trump	But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country.	0
468	Donald Trump	They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be.	0
469	Donald Trump	They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference.	0
470	Donald Trump	So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after.	0
471	Donald Trump	We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.	0
472	Julie Pace	And that's going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?	0
473	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
474	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
475	Donald Trump	That's our policy.	0
476	Donald Trump	I am not saying... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem.	0
477	Donald Trump	But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly.	0
478	Donald Trump	We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun.	0
479	Donald Trump	They are being thrown in jails and they are being... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that.	0
480	Donald Trump	We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth...	0
481	Julie Pace	A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you.	0
482	Julie Pace	I don't want to give them the wrong message with this.	0
483	Donald Trump	Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy.	0
484	Donald Trump	OK?	0
485	Donald Trump	I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy...	0
486	SYSTEM	[An aide talks about Trump's address to Congress]	0
487	Donald Trump	A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.	0
488	Julie Pace	You seem like you enjoyed it.	0
489	Donald Trump	I did.	0
490	Donald Trump	I did.	0
491	Donald Trump	I believed in it and I enjoyed it.	0
492	Donald Trump	It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information.	0
493	Donald Trump	Have you seen the tremendous success?...	0
494	Donald Trump	That's another thing that nobody talks about.	0
495	Donald Trump	Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When	0
496	SYSTEM	[Haider al]	0
497	Donald Trump	Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it.	0
498	Donald Trump	We don't talk about it.	0
499	Julie Pace	Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it?	0
500	Donald Trump	I don't talk about it.	0
501	Donald Trump	No.	0
502	Donald Trump	And the generals don't talk about it.	0
503	Julie Pace	You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days.	0
504	Julie Pace	I know they have sent that over.	0
505	Julie Pace	Have you accepted a plan?	0
506	Julie Pace	Are you moving forward on a strategy?	0
507	Donald Trump	We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.	0
508	Julie Pace	So you have decided on a plan?	0
509	Donald Trump	Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.	0
510	Julie Pace	Right.	0
511	Donald Trump	Right.	0
512	Donald Trump	Mosul.	0
513	Donald Trump	Four months we are going in, three months.	0
514	Donald Trump	We are still fighting Mosul.	0
515	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
516	Donald Trump	Because they were prepared.	0
517	Donald Trump	If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.	0
518	Julie Pace	Can you say generally what the strategy is?	0
519	Julie Pace	Should people --	0
520	Donald Trump	Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS.	0
521	Donald Trump	We have no choice.	0
522	Donald Trump	And other terrorist organizations.	0
523	Julie Pace	Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?	0
524	Donald Trump	No, not much.	0
525	Julie Pace	In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals --	0
526	Donald Trump	Well, they've also accepted my strategy.	0
527	Julie Pace	Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?	0
528	Donald Trump	Not many.	0
529	Julie Pace	So a small increase?	0
530	Donald Trump	It could be an increase, then an increase.	0
531	Donald Trump	But not many more.	0
532	Donald Trump	I want to do the job, but not many more....	0
533	Donald Trump	This is an important story.	0
534	Donald Trump	I've done a lot.	0
535	Donald Trump	I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier.	1
536	Donald Trump	And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things.	0
537	Donald Trump	With foreign countries.	0
538	Donald Trump	Look at, look at President Xi.	0
539	Donald Trump	I mean ...	0
540	Julie Pace	What do you think it was about your chemistry?	0
541	Donald Trump	We had good chemistry.	0
542	Donald Trump	Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.	0
543	Julie Pace	Uh-huh.	0
544	Donald Trump	Look, he turned down many coal ships.	0
545	Donald Trump	These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income.	0
546	Donald Trump	They're coming into China and they're being turned away.	0
547	Donald Trump	That's never happened before.	0
548	Donald Trump	The fuel, the oil, so many different things.	0
549	Donald Trump	You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera.	0
550	Donald Trump	People have said they've never seen this ever before in China.	0
551	Donald Trump	We have the same relationship with others.	0
552	Donald Trump	There's a great foundation that's built.	0
553	Donald Trump	Great foundation.	0
554	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.	0
555	Julie Pace	One more 100 days question.	0
556	Donald Trump	That's fine.	0
557	Julie Pace	... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?	0
558	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
559	Donald Trump	I think my team has been, well, I have different teams.	0
560	Donald Trump	I think my military team has been treated with great respect.	0
561	Donald Trump	As they should be.	0
562	Donald Trump	I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get.	0
563	Donald Trump	We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.	0
564	Julie Pace	Do you mean your White House team when you say that?	0
565	Donald Trump	Yeah, my White House team.	0
566	Donald Trump	I think Reince has been doing an excellent job.	0
567	Donald Trump	I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me.	0
568	Donald Trump	Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them.	0
569	Donald Trump	You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is.	0
570	Donald Trump	If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California.	0
571	Donald Trump	It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do.	0
572	Donald Trump	So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start.	0
573	Donald Trump	OK.	0
574	Donald Trump	The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard.	0
575	Donald Trump	Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College.	0
576	Donald Trump	His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive.	0
577	Donald Trump	You lose New York, you lose Illinois.	0
578	Donald Trump	Illinois is impossible to win.	0
579	Donald Trump	And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California.	0
580	Donald Trump	Right.	0
581	Donald Trump	And you say, man.	0
582	Donald Trump	Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina.	0
583	Donald Trump	You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.	0
584	Julie Pace	Right.	0
585	Donald Trump	So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent.	0
586	Donald Trump	Hundreds of millions... Yeah.	0
587	Donald Trump	Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion.	0
588	Donald Trump	But whatever.	0
589	Donald Trump	She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost.	0
590	Donald Trump	Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306.	0
591	Donald Trump	So there's anger.	0
592	Donald Trump	But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes.	0
593	Donald Trump	I mean, here's a judge who is No.	0
594	Donald Trump	1 at Columbia, No.	0
595	Donald Trump	1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar.	0
596	Donald Trump	And he got three votes.	0
597	Julie Pace	Three Democratic votes, but yeah.	0
598	Donald Trump	Three Democratic votes.	0
599	Donald Trump	OK.	0
600	Donald Trump	He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level.	0
601	Donald Trump	The No.	0
602	Donald Trump	1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers.	0
603	Donald Trump	No bad decisions with all... nothing.	0
604	Donald Trump	He's like a ...	0
605	Julie Pace	Do you think that you can break through that?	0
606	Julie Pace	I mean this --	0
607	Donald Trump	Yeah, I do.	0
608	Julie Pace	Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.	0
609	Donald Trump	I think I can to an extent.	0
610	Donald Trump	But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through.	0
611	Donald Trump	There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't.	0
612	Donald Trump	It's sad.	0
613	Donald Trump	You can't.	0
614	Donald Trump	Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot.	0
615	Donald Trump	Elijah Cummings.	0
616	Donald Trump	I really liked him a lot.	0
617	Donald Trump	And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices.	0
618	Donald Trump	He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous.	0
619	Donald Trump	And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that.	0
620	Donald Trump	He said you will be the greatest president.	0
621	Donald Trump	He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.	0
622	Julie Pace	He disputed that slightly.	0
623	Donald Trump	That's what he said.	0
624	Donald Trump	I mean, what can I tell you?	0
625	Julie Pace	Yeah.	0
626	Donald Trump	There's six people sitting here.	0
