Economic growth has surged to 2.6% nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. And at 3% growth in West Virginia. I wonder how that happened. 3% growth. West Virginia, you are leading the average. When was the last time you heard that, West Virginia? You are leading the country's average. Remember I told you don't sell your homes. Don't sell your homes. You are doing great. I'm so proud of you. You know, we won the state by 42 points. Can you believe that? 42 points. I asked your Republican party leader how would we be doing today versus November 8th and Election Day. He said honestly, President Trump, you are doing better. I said better? 42 points since our election, not mine, since our election we've added more than one million new jobs. And the good news keeping on pouring in. In fact, we have a very important announcement to make tonight. Does anybody know what that announcement is? Does anybody know what that announcement is? We have a very, very large announcement. Do you understand? Large. So I would like to invite my good friend and your Governor, Jim Justice, up to the stage to share this news with all of you. Jim, come on up. Come on up, Jim. Look at this guy. Jim is going to say a few words. These words have not been spoken by a major political figure, meaning Governor or Senator in our country for a long time. Thank you. First of all, it is a real honor. Thank you for coming. Thank our great President for being here. I've got to tell you a couple of stories real quick. I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last few weeks. I've been to present an idea on coal and manufacturing. I've had the great opportunity to be with our President. Let me tell you just this. I have to be serious with you just a moment. I have to tell you at the last session of our legislature I tried with all of my soul. Now I can tell you if you'll just give me just a moment. This man and myself are are not politicians. We ran to get something done. We ran and gave up part of our lives. We ran, because we want nothing. We ran as our founding fathers did years and years ago to serve now I will promise you until my soul that no one loves West Virginia more than I. In the last session, I would tell you that there was something greatness to passed with our rows and so on. But there was way too much pain. Now listen to me and listen really good. We hurt a lot of people. We hurt our vets and our teachers and our disabled and our weak and we walked away from at the old. Now I can promise you just this, I came -- I came to only get something done. Let me just say this to you as bluntly as I can say it. West Virginia, at the altar when we had it done, like it or not like it, but the Democrats walked away from me. Now today I would tell you with los of prayers and lots of thinking, today I'll tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you being a Democrat Governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican. Applause, Cheers]	0
74	Jim Justice	As a coach, I would tell you it is time to run another play.	0

123	Donald Trump	We talked about how we are working together to open up the coal mines in this state and also very importantly to create jobs in furniture manufacturing, and other forms of manufacturing very important to Jim.	0
124	Donald Trump	But Governor Justice did something else very important tonight.	0
125	Donald Trump	He showed the country that our agenda rises above left or right it is an agenda for all of the people, especially for the tens of millions of forgotten Americans.	0
126	Donald Trump	They are not so forgotten anymore.	0
127	Donald Trump	I will tell you.	0
128	Donald Trump	He approved that.	0
129	Donald Trump	You proved it.	0
130	Donald Trump	They are not forgotten anymore.	0
131	Donald Trump	Countless citizens, Democrats, and Republicans, independents, have been neglected and ignored by Washington.	0
132	Donald Trump	But we will make sure they are never ignored again.	0
133	Donald Trump	We know there are powerful forces in Washington who want to stomp us.	0
134	Donald Trump	But we won't let them.	0
135	Donald Trump	We are fighting for every American who has been overlooked, pushed aside, or told to put their dreams on hold but we will win and we're winning though.	0
136	Donald Trump	The failed voices in Washington who oppose our movement are the exact same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another.	0
137	Donald Trump	Who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another, and who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.	0
138	Donald Trump	They gave them away.	0
139	Donald Trump	We don't need advice from the Washington swamp.	0
140	Donald Trump	We need to drain the swamp.	0
141	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
142	Donald Trump	Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.	0
143	Donald Trump	You know it better than most.	0
144	Donald Trump	I didn't come to Washington for me.	0

151	Donald Trump	The question for Democrats -- all Democrats, including those in Congress, is whether they are on the side of the voters or are they on the side of the special interests?	0
152	Donald Trump	The reason why Democrats only talk about at the totally made up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision.	0
153	Donald Trump	They don't talk about the all time high stock market.	0
154	Donald Trump	They don't talk about reforms to the V.A.	0
155	Donald Trump	Or about manufacturing jobs we're bringing back to America by the hundreds of thousands.	0
156	Donald Trump	They don't talk about the Keystone pipeline that I immediately approved or the Dakota Access Pipeline.	0
157	Donald Trump	Russia story is a total fabrication.	0
158	Donald Trump	It is just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics.	0
159	Donald Trump	That's all it is.	0
160	Donald Trump	It is just makes them feel better what they have nothing else to talk about.	0
161	Donald Trump	What the prosecutor should be look at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted e-mails, and they should be looking at the paid Russian speeches.	0
162	Donald Trump	And the owned Russian companies.	0
163	Donald Trump	Or let them look at at the uranium she sold that's now in the hands of very angry Russian.	1
164	Donald Trump	Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign.	0
165	Donald Trump	There never were.	0
166	Donald Trump	We didn't win because of Russia.	0
167	Donald Trump	We won because of you.	0
168	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.	0
169	Donald Trump	We won because we totally out worked the other side.	0
170	Donald Trump	We won because millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country.	0
171	Donald Trump	Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?	0
172	Donald Trump	Are there any Russians here tonight?	0
173	Donald Trump	Any Russians?	0
174	Donald Trump	They can't beat us at the voting booths.	0
175	Donald Trump	They are trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.	0
176	Donald Trump	They are trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.	0
177	Donald Trump	I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one.	0
178	Donald Trump	Which is what at the the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve.	0
179	Donald Trump	And what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve Democrat lawmakers will have to decide.	0
180	Donald Trump	They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax, or they can serve the interests of the American people.	0
181	Donald Trump	Try winning a the voter booth.	0
182	Donald Trump	Try winning at the voter booth.	0
183	Donald Trump	Not going to be easy.	0
184	Donald Trump	But that's the way you are supposed to do it.	0
185	Donald Trump	Our agenda is the pro-growth agenda.	0
186	Donald Trump	We want to control our boarders and lift our people from welfare to work.	0
187	Donald Trump	We want to support our police and make our communities safe.	0
188	Donald Trump	We want to reduce taxes and increase wages for all of our people.	0
189	Donald Trump	We want to get the special interest out of politics for good.	0
190	Donald Trump	And we want to bring back our plants and our factories and our manufacturing and that's what is happening right now.	0
191	Donald Trump	You see it, and so does every other state in our union.	0
192	Donald Trump	That is why in the proud tradition of America's great leaders from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt, we are protecting American workers and we are protecting American industry for the first time in many, many decades.	0
193	Donald Trump	No longer will we allow other considerations to close our jobs, steal our factories, and drain our wealth.	0
194	Donald Trump	We are building our future with American labor and hands and aluminum and steel and, what else, coal.	0
195	Donald Trump	We will buy American and we will hire American.	0
196	Donald Trump	To protect our jobs and our industry, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
197	Donald Trump	And to protect our workers and coal miners, I also withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
198	Donald Trump	But not only are we bringing back our jobs, we are bringing back our safety.	0
199	Donald Trump	We have seen the bloodshed and devastation inflicted by terrorists in America, in Europe, and all across the world I said it during the campaign.	0
200	Donald Trump	I will say it again right here tonight.	0
201	Donald Trump	We will keep radical, Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
202	SYSTEM	[Applause, Crowd chants USA]	0
203	Donald Trump	we only want to admit people in our country who love our people and who share our values.	0
204	Donald Trump	We're also keeping our country safe from criminal gangs and violent crime.	0
205	Donald Trump	We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers.	0
206	Donald Trump	Human traffickers.	0
207	Donald Trump	And the vile criminal cartels like MS-13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count.	0
208	Donald Trump	Just last week I visited Long Island.	0
209	Donald Trump	MS-13 has brought violence to a once-peaceful and beautiful neighborhood right where I grew up.	0
210	Donald Trump	We are liberating American communities from the vicious, violent gangs.	0
211	Donald Trump	One by one we're finding the drug dealers, gang members, thieves, criminals, and predators, and we're throwing them out of our country.	0
212	Donald Trump	Once they are gone, we will not let them back in.	0
213	Donald Trump	We are stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.	0
214	Donald Trump	You have a big problem in West Virginia and we are going to solve that problem.	0
215	Donald Trump	We are cracking down strongly on sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens.	0
216	Donald Trump	And in order to stop the drugs, gangs, and traffickers, we are building a wall on the southern border.	0
217	Donald Trump	I also proudly announced legislation this week with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue to perform our immigration system to protect American workers and American taxpayers.	0
218	Donald Trump	It is called the raise act.	0
219	Donald Trump	R-A-I-S-E.	0
220	Donald Trump	The Raise Act.	0
221	Donald Trump	For many years America has issued most of the green cards to lower-skilled immigrants.	0
222	Donald Trump	And people who had no hope of getting a job.	0
223	Donald Trump	Undermining blue collar workers and wages and costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year.	0
224	Donald Trump	The Raise Act switches to a merit-based system.	0
225	Donald Trump	You come in largely based on merit.	0
226	Donald Trump	Doesn't that sound nice?	0
227	Donald Trump	Wouldn't that be nice?	0
228	Donald Trump	It is about time.	0
229	Donald Trump	Our proposal prevents new immigrants from going on welfare for at least five years.	0
230	Donald Trump	So you don't come in and go on welfare.	0
231	Donald Trump	Our plan favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and who demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country.	0
232	Donald Trump	We believe decisions on who immigrants are in our country should be based on the best interest of America and the best interest of the American people.	0
233	Donald Trump	You.	0
234	Donald Trump	We are working to honor millions and million of workers who came out and voted for us.	0
235	Donald Trump	That's why I will repeat again tonight that Congress must do its job, keep its promise, live up to its were, and repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
236	Donald Trump	You have to do it.	0
237	Donald Trump	Fog in life is easy.	0
238	Donald Trump	But Congress must not give in.	0
239	Donald Trump	They must not give up.	0
240	Donald Trump	But instead, Congress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they've been talking about for seven years.	0
241	Donald Trump	Incredible.	0
242	Donald Trump	One vote.	0
243	Donald Trump	Incredible.	0

246	Donald Trump	They can't give up.	0
247	Donald Trump	Call your Congressman, call your Senators, call everybody.	0
248	Donald Trump	Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
249	Donald Trump	Which is a disaster.	0
250	Donald Trump	To be a prosperous nation, it is critical we lower the tax burden on our workers and businesses.	0
251	Donald Trump	The United States has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world.	0
252	Donald Trump	We want to bring it down to one of the lowest, because we want more growth, more jobs, and high er pay.	0
253	Donald Trump	That's what's doing to happen.	0
254	Donald Trump	And importantly, we also want to let Americans keep more of their own money.	0
255	Donald Trump	Not take it from them.	0
256	Donald Trump	It is time to pass a tax cut for middle class families.	0
257	Donald Trump	Finally, and you'll see very soon what you are hearing about it, my administration is committed to rebuilding the deleted infrastructure of the United States.	0
258	Donald Trump	Think of it.	0
259	Donald Trump	We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East and the Middle East is a hundred times worse than it was 16 years ago when we started.	0
260	Donald Trump	Can you believe this?	0
261	Donald Trump	What a shame.	0
262	Donald Trump	That's why we are pushing a $1 trillion new infrastructure investment bill.	0
263	Donald Trump	We're going to fix our roads, we're going to fix our bridges, we're going to fix our highways and our schools and our airports we will create amazing monuments that inspire awe and wonder in our people.	0
264	Donald Trump	It used to be that way.	0
265	Donald Trump	It is not that way any longer.	0
266	Donald Trump	We have airports that look like third world countries.	0
267	Donald Trump	It is not going to be that way anymore.	0
268	Donald Trump	American workers will build this great future.	0
269	Donald Trump	And American energy and American clean coal will power this future.	0
270	Donald Trump	We are the nation that put a man on the moon that dug out the Panama Canal, and that won two world wars.	0
271	Donald Trump	We can do anything, we can build anything with and we can dream anything.	0
