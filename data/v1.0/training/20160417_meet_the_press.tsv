1	CHUCK TODD	This Sunday, a $353,000 ticket to a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.	0
2	CHUCK TODD	My exclusive interview with the host of that event, George Clooney.	0
3	CHUCK TODD	advertisement	0
4	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's an obscene amount of money.	0
5	GEORGE CLOONEY	And it's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.	0
6	CHUCK TODD	George Clooney on Clinton, Trump, and all that money in politics.	0
7	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us.	0
8	CHUCK TODD	Plus, the Republican party at war with itself.	0
9	DONALD TRUMP	This is a rigged system, folks.	0
10	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican system is a rigged system.	0
11	DONALD TRUMP	advertisement	0
12	CHUCK TODD	The Trump campaign is trying to be more disciplined.	0
13	CHUCK TODD	But is it too late for the candidate to change the script?	0
14	CHUCK TODD	Republican chairman Reince Priebus joins me.	0
15	CHUCK TODD	Also, North Carolina's new so-called "bathroom" law.	0
16	CHUCK TODD	Does it discriminate against the L.G.B.T.	0
17	CHUCK TODD	community?	0
18	CHUCK TODD	I'll ask the governor, Pat McCrory, if he now regrets signing a bill that has cost is state so much money.	0
19	CHUCK TODD	And joining me for insight and analysis are MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, and Perry Bacon of NBC News.	0
20	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
21	ANNOUNCER	From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
22	CHUCK TODD	Good Sunday morning.	0
23	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump got wiped out in the delegate race in yet another state yesterday.	0
24	CHUCK TODD	In Wyoming, Ted Cruz won all the delegates that were up for grabs at yesterday's Wyoming state convention.	0
25	CHUCK TODD	Now Trump says it would have been a waste of time and money for him to campaign there, claiming, "The system is rigged," and that the Republican establishment is simply trying to take the nomination away from him.	0
26	CHUCK TODD	We're going to get to that story later in the show.	0
27	CHUCK TODD	But we're going to begin with the Democrats and the intersection of money, politics, and Hollywood.	0
28	CHUCK TODD	And my surprisingly frank conversation with George Clooney.	0
29	CHUCK TODD	Last night in Los Angeles, and the night before in San Francisco, George and Amal Clooney hosted fundraisers for Hillary Clinton, where the top ticket sets you back $353,000.	0
30	CHUCK TODD	For that price, you got to sit at the same table with Hillary Clinton and the Clooneys.	0
31	CHUCK TODD	It was very much an event for the 1 percent of the 1 percent.	0
32	CHUCK TODD	This big-money fundraiser did not escape the attention of the Bernie Sanders campaign or his supporters who last night threw dollar bills, real ones, at Clinton's motorcade.	0
33	CHUCK TODD	advertisement	0
34	CHUCK TODD	Sanders, of course, has made opposing Wall Street and money in politics the centerpiece of his campaign.	0
35	CHUCK TODD	I got a chance yesterday to talk to George Clooney from his home outside of L.A. And he was very open and candid about what he thought about all that money that is pouring into campaigns at events like the one he hosted.	0
36	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)	0
37	CHUCK TODD	Mr. Clooney, welcome to MeetthePress.	0
38	GEORGE CLOONEY	Thank you, Chuck.	0
39	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with dinner you co-hosted on Friday night, a big fundraiser.	0
40	CHUCK TODD	I know that you have plans for later tonight.	0
41	CHUCK TODD	Do you look at how much is being raised and, I think the cost of the friday night dinner $353,000 a couple to be a co-chair, do you look at it yourself and think, "That's an obscene amount of money?"	0
42	GEORGE CLOONEY	Yes.	0
43	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's an obscene amount of money.	0
44	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think that, you know, we had some protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco and they're right to protest.	0
45	GEORGE CLOONEY	They're absolutely right.	0
46	GEORGE CLOONEY	It is an obscene amount of money.	0
47	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right.	0
48	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.	0
49	GEORGE CLOONEY	I agree completely.	0
50	GEORGE CLOONEY	advertisement	0
51	CHUCK TODD	You know, it was interesting.	0
52	CHUCK TODD	We caught, our camera caught you having a conversation with the protesters last night.	0
53	CHUCK TODD	What did you say to them?	0
54	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, it was a funny thing.	0
55	GEORGE CLOONEY	I went over to try to talk to them and you said I was some corporate shill which, you know, me that's one of the funnier things you could say about me.	0
56	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then he just said, you know, "You sucked as Batman."	0
57	GEORGE CLOONEY	And I was like, "Well, you kind of got me on that one."	0
58	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then I walked away and that was basically it.	0
59	GEORGE CLOONEY	But, you know, I think what's important and what I think the Clinton campaign has not been very good at explaining is this and this is the truth: the overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for President, it's going to the down-ticket.	1
60	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.	0
61	GEORGE CLOONEY	And the reason that's important and the reason it's important to me is because we need, I'm a Democrat so if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree but we need to take the senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again.	0
62	GEORGE CLOONEY	And that's why I'm doing it.	0
63	CHUCK TODD	So you don't enjoy doing these fundraisers?	0
64	GEORGE CLOONEY	No, I don't think anybody does.	0
65	GEORGE CLOONEY	I don't even think politicians do.	0
66	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, I'm sure you've covered them before.	0
67	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's not the most fun thing to do.	0
68	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, I spend probably a quarter of my time now raising millions and millions of dollars to fund my foundation which is basically chasing and looking for money that these corrupt politicians all around the world are hiding.	0
69	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Panama papers have been actually incredibly helpful.	0
70	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have forensic accountants so this is all a very big part of things that are important to me.	0
71	GEORGE CLOONEY	I really want Citizens United.	0
72	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it's the worst, one of the worst laws passed, since I've been around.	0
73	CHUCK TODD	You know, Bernie Sanders, obviously you've noted that his campaign was criticizing this and he was asked about your fundraiser specifically and he tried he backed off and he said this:	0
74	BERNIE SANDERS	It's not a criticism of Clooney; it's a criticism of corrupt campaign finance system where big money interests and it's not Clooney, it's the people who are coming to this event that end up having undue influence over the political process.	0
75	CHUCK TODD	Do you think people that are coming to your event tonight and went last night, that they think they're gonna get extra access to Hillary Clinton, to a President Clinton?	0
76	GEORGE CLOONEY	No.	0
77	GEORGE CLOONEY	I actually don't think that's true.	0
78	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us, you know?	0
79	GEORGE CLOONEY	The difference is if I succeed, if we succeed in electing an entire Congress which would be quite a success but a Senate and a President, you know, the tax policies that they would enact would probably cost us a lot more money quite honestly.	0
80	GEORGE CLOONEY	The Koch brothers would profit if they get their way and that's what, you know, there's no profit for us in this.	0
81	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, understanding this: Koch brothers have said that they're gonna spend $900 million not on the presidency but on the down-ticket, on the senators and the congressman and the gubernatorial races and local races.	0
82	GEORGE CLOONEY	And so our job is to try and counter that in some way.	0
83	CHUCK TODD	You actually have plenty of nice things to say about Bernie Sanders.	0
84	CHUCK TODD	I think you did an interview with TheGuardian where you said you like the issues he was bringing up, you thought he was actually pushing Hillary Clinton in a certain way.	0
85	CHUCK TODD	I am curious; why did you pick Clinton over Sanders?	0
86	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country.	0
87	GEORGE CLOONEY	And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.	0
88	GEORGE CLOONEY	And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen.	0
89	GEORGE CLOONEY	She understood it.	0
90	GEORGE CLOONEY	She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan.	0
91	GEORGE CLOONEY	We don't trade with them.	0
92	GEORGE CLOONEY	We don't get money from them.	0
93	GEORGE CLOONEY	I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be-- and to care about the issues.	0
94	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers.	0
95	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I want to say this: I really like Bernie.	0
96	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat.	0
97	GEORGE CLOONEY	Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.	0
98	CHUCK TODD	You have minced no words about your feelings about Donald Trump.	0
99	CHUCK TODD	I think you called him a, "xenophobic fascist."	0
100	CHUCK TODD	I hope I'm quoting you correctly.	0
101	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think you're pretty close.	0
102	CHUCK TODD	Okay.	0
103	CHUCK TODD	Fair enough.	0
104	CHUCK TODD	What have your interactions been with him?	0
105	CHUCK TODD	You ever have any personal interaction?	0
106	GEORGE CLOONEY	I met him once.	0
107	GEORGE CLOONEY	I've met him once.	0
108	GEORGE CLOONEY	I was sitting down at a table and he was nice.	0
109	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we talked a couple of times, I think.	0
110	GEORGE CLOONEY	And then he went on Larry King and told everybody I was very short.	0
111	GEORGE CLOONEY	I wish I had said "I met you sitting down."	0
112	GEORGE CLOONEY	But, no.	0
113	GEORGE CLOONEY	It's not about that.	0
114	GEORGE CLOONEY	You know, here's the point about what's going on right now on the other side.	0
115	GEORGE CLOONEY	Trump and Cruz are making this a campaign of fear.	0
116	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of everything.	0
117	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of refugees.	0
118	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of Muslims.	0
119	GEORGE CLOONEY	We have to be afraid of minorities.	0
120	GEORGE CLOONEY	And the question is and this is an important one, are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great?	0
121	GEORGE CLOONEY	And if the answer is, "Yes," then we have history to answer to because we're not afraid.	0
122	GEORGE CLOONEY	We are not a country that is afraid and I refuse to accept that.	0
123	CHUCK TODD	Why do you think fear has been working at least in the Republican party?	0
124	GEORGE CLOONEY	Because fear's always worked one way or another.	0
125	GEORGE CLOONEY	In elections, fear has always been a great -- one of the great tools of any election.	0
126	GEORGE CLOONEY	But the reality is we are not the descendants of fearful people.	0
127	GEORGE CLOONEY	We're not.	0
128	GEORGE CLOONEY	So no, we're not going to ban Muslims from this country.	0
129	GEORGE CLOONEY	That's never going to happen.	0
130	GEORGE CLOONEY	And we're not going to go back to torture and we're not going to kill the families of terrorists or suspected terrorists because that is not who we are.	0
131	GEORGE CLOONEY	And if we did, our grandparents and their parents would be ashamed of us.	0
132	CHUCK TODD	I'm curious; Hollywood and a lot of movie studios were very aggressive in putting pressure on the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would have perhaps made it easier to discriminate gays and lesbians and transgender folks.	0
133	CHUCK TODD	Some of that same pressure is being applied to North Carolina.	0
134	CHUCK TODD	First of all do you approve of pressure like that, number one, and what do you make of the North Carolina law?	0
135	GEORGE CLOONEY	Well, I'm a protester from way back.	0
136	GEORGE CLOONEY	I got arrested in DC a couple years ago with my father protesting.	0
137	GEORGE CLOONEY	I'm a big believer in protests.	0
138	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think it matters from the '56 Montgomery bus protest to the apartheid protests that I was a part of when I was a young man.	0
139	GEORGE CLOONEY	But I find these to be really effective because these are big corporations that are protesting.	0
140	GEORGE CLOONEY	And when you have IBM and Walmart of all people and General Electric and people like that coming at you, it affects people.	0
141	GEORGE CLOONEY	And you can see it because we saw it with Mike Pence in Indiana.	0
142	GEORGE CLOONEY	We saw it with Jan Brewer in Arizona.	0
143	GEORGE CLOONEY	I think they can have some great effect and I think the law is ridiculous, of course.	0
144	CHUCK TODD	All right.	0
145	CHUCK TODD	George Clooney, I've kept you long enough.	0
146	CHUCK TODD	Thanks for coming on.	0
147	CHUCK TODD	Appreciate it.	0
148	GEORGE CLOONEY	Thank you, Chuck, I appreciate it.	0
149	CHUCK TODD	You got it.	0
150	CHUCK TODD	As you saw there, that was George Clooney, a Clinton supporter, striking an unusually conciliatory tone towards Bernie Sanders these days.	0
151	CHUCK TODD	But Thursday night's debate between the candidates got pretty heated and it was not so conciliatory.	0
152	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO)	0
153	HILLARY CLINTON	You know, wait a minute, wait a minute, come on.	0
154	BERNIE SANDERS	That's just not accurate.	0
155	HILLARY CLINTON	Come on.	0
156	HILLARY CLINTON	I have stood on the debate stage--	0
157	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf!	0
158	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf!	0
159	BERNIE SANDERS	Can I--	0
160	HILLARY CLINTON	--with Senator Sanders eight prior times.	0
161	HILLARY CLINTON	I have said the exact same thing--	0
162	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf.	0
163	BERNIE SANDERS	Wolf.	0
164	BERNIE SANDERS	Excuse me, Wolf?	0
165	WOLF BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, please.	0
166	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)	0
167	CHUCK TODD	There you go.	0
168	CHUCK TODD	The New York primary is on Tuesday.	0
169	CHUCK TODD	Joining me now is the chair of the Democratic party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, as well as our panel is going to be joining in here with the questioning.	0
170	CHUCK TODD	But Madam Chairman, nice to see you.	0
171	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Nice to see you, too.	0
172	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with what George Clooney said.	0
173	CHUCK TODD	He agreed this fundraiser, which benefits a big chunk of the DNC, obscene.	0
174	CHUCK TODD	Do you agree with him?	0
175	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Absolutely.	0
176	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	We agree as a party that there is an obscene amount of money in politics.	0
177	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And that's why our members, I'm a co-sponsor, along with many of my colleagues of a constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United.	0
178	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	We need to make sure that we can keep elections that, like we did with changing congressional districting and redistricting across the country, that voters can choose their representatives and that we don't have outside undue influence come in and swoop in and, uh, make decisions on behalf of the majority of voters.	0
179	CHUCK TODD	As I said, people see the panel is here.	0
180	CHUCK TODD	Chris Matthews of Hardball, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, Perry Bacon of NBC News, Hugh Hewitt, the radio program Hugh Hewitt Show.	0
181	CHUCK TODD	Chris, fire away.	0
182	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Well, I think one thing Bernie Sanders is saying in his ads I don't think is true.	0
183	CHRIS MATTHEWS	He's talking about members of Congress, people in Washington, taking money for speeches.	0
184	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You're not allowed to do that.	0
185	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	You’re not allowed to do that.	0
186	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You guys voted that out years ago.	0
187	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	That's right.	0
188	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	They're not allowed to do that.	0
189	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	There are no honorariums.	0
190	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And, look, the bottom line here is that we have two candidates who are at the more narrow end of the funnel now as we end the primary election contest.	0
191	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And it's going to get more heated.	0
192	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	But look, compared to the Republicans who are in utter chaos, our two candidates have been substantive and robust, they've kept largely to the issues that are important to the American people, talked about how they want to build on President Obama's congressional delegates, uh, congressional Democrats' legacy, and we want to move the country forward and help people reach the middle class.	0
193	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And they have slightly different approaches to how to get there, but it's been a substantive discussion.	0
194	CHUCK TODD	Yeah, slightly.	0
195	CHUCK TODD	Okay.	0
196	CHUCK TODD	Perry, go ahead.	0
197	PERRY BACON	Chairman, Bernie Sanders this week has really attacked the 1990s in some ways.	0
198	PERRY BACON	He says the crime bill of '94 and the welfare reform bill of 1996 were bad legislation.	0
199	PERRY BACON	Do you agree with that?	0
200	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	You know, I think that the impact of the crime bill has had some important effects and some detrimental effects.	0
201	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And so, you know, both of our candidates voted for the crime bill.	0
202	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And I think most Democrats would agree that there needs to be reforms so that we can make sure that sentencing and the way we manage our criminal justice system is a lot more equitable and fair than it is today.	0
203	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen?	0
204	KATHLEEN PARKER	Yeah, going back to the financing of political campaigns, everybody loves to talk about how much we dislike Citizens United, you'll find people on both sides, Republicans dislike it too, at least a lot of them do.	0
205	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Certainly, but that’s certainly not reflected in how they vote--	0
206	KATHLEEN PARKER	Well, Mitt Romney was one who spoke out about, you know, how much he disliked it because it gives so much power to people who are sort of marginal participants	0
207	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	While benefiting from it handsomely.	0
208	KATHLEEN PARKER	But that's not really my question.	0
209	KATHLEEN PARKER	I'm just laying that out as the prefatory note.	0
210	KATHLEEN PARKER	What I want to know is, is there ever any serious consideration given to a possibility of just limiting campaigns as other countries do, to two months, say?	0
211	KATHLEEN PARKER	And make them completely publicly funded.	0
212	KATHLEEN PARKER	Is that ever anything that gets serious consideration and would it be possible?	0
213	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Only by Democrats.	0
214	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I mean, certainly, Democrats have supported public financing of campaigns, I know I do, and many of my colleagues do.	0
215	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And we do need to, you know, have an effort that both sides come together, and try to make that reform.	0
216	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	But Republicans have no interest in changing the campaign finance system.	0
217	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	They support the hundreds of millions of dollars of outside undue influence swooping in and weighing heavily on the outcome of any election contest.	0
218	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	It's obscene and we need to elect majorities in Congress so Democrats can make a difference in changing it.	0
219	CHUCK TODD	Hugh, last question.	0
220	HUGH HEWITT	Chairwoman, let me bring up something that did not come up in the more cowbell debate from Thursday night.	0
221	HUGH HEWITT	And that is if after Lewandowski was charged, many Democrats and many Republicans said of Donald Trump's campaign manager that he should be fired, and he wasn't.	0
222	HUGH HEWITT	If any of Secretary Clinton's aides are indicted in the F.B.I.	0
223	HUGH HEWITT	server investigation, should they also be fired?	0
224	HUGH HEWITT	Should the same standard apply?	0
225	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	That is a question that I'm not even going near.	0
226	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I don't think that's going to happen.	0
227	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	And at the end of the day, we are going to have a campaign that will play out.	0
228	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Our nominee will ultimately be elected president of the United States because we are on the side of the American people, and ultimately our candidate--	0
229	HUGH HEWITT	It's not about whether or not it's going to happen, it's about the standard.	0
230	HUGH HEWITT	If a senior aide is ever indicted in a campaign, as Mr. Lewandowski was, should they be fired immediately?	0
231	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Again, I don't think that that's going to happen.	0
232	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	So it's not a question that is one that I think makes sense to answer.	0
233	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	I'm focused on making sure that when we get to the end of our primary, we're preparing for the general election and we can and will elect our nominee, the 45th president of the United States.	0
234	CHUCK TODD	I'm going to leave it there.	0
235	CHUCK TODD	Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Madam Chairwoman.	0
236	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thank you.	0
237	CHUCK TODD	Thanks for coming in.	0
238	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thanks for having me.	0
239	CHUCK TODD	And coming to the table.	0
240	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Absolutely.	0
241	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Any time.	0
242	CHUCK TODD	And I appreciate it.	0
243	CHUCK TODD	All right.	0
244	REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ	Thanks.	0
245	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, the Republican race.	0
246	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump loses a delegate contest, and yet another state at a convention.	0
247	CHUCK TODD	If he can't stop the bleeding, can he beat Ted Cruz at this summer's convention if he can't win on the first ballot?	0
248	CHUCK TODD	If you want to know why Donald Trump is so frustrated with the delegate selection process, here's yet another example.	0
249	CHUCK TODD	Yesterday in Wyoming, Ted Cruz, without a primary or a caucus, won all 14 delegates available at the state convention.	0
250	CHUCK TODD	It means Cruz wound up with 23 pledged delegates from Wyoming with Trump and Marco Rubio each receiving just one.	0
251	CHUCK TODD	So what happened in Wyoming has been typical of this campaign.	0
252	CHUCK TODD	Though Trump is winning the overall battle for votes, and delegates say in primaries, he's losing the hand-to-hand combat over delegates that are awarded at state conventions.	0
253	CHUCK TODD	And as a result, Trump has ricocheted between trashing the Republican National Committee and trying to make peace with it.	0
254	CHUCK TODD	And it's clear now though that Donald Trump realizes the game is about winning on the first ballot at the convention, or he's doomed.	0
255	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)	0
256	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap.	0
257	CHUCK TODD	The fight between the Republican frontrunner and the Republican party, smoldering for days, is turning to an all-out war.	0
258	DONALD TRUMP	The system, folks, is rigged.	0
259	DONALD TRUMP	It's a rigged system.	0
260	DONALD TRUMP	Because it's a rigged system, folks.	0
261	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican system is rigged, okay?	0
262	CHUCK TODD	An on-again/off-again feud with party leaders is ratcheting up, even as Trump tries a campaign reboot.	0
263	CHUCK TODD	After a crushing 13-point defeat in Wisconsin, Trump turned a page, sidelining campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.	0
264	DONALD TRUMP	He wasn't quite as effective for the past couple of months.	0
265	CHUCK TODD	Hiring a new delegate wrangler, Paul Manafort, and a political director with close ties to the R.N.C.	0
266	CHUCK TODD	Reaching out to members of Congress, and limiting exposure to the media to just friendly interviews.	0
267	DONALD TRUMP	When I take them out, I will be so presidentialyou won't believe it.	0
268	CHUCK TODD	But even as Trump's new team attempts to keep him scripted--	0
269	DONALD TRUMP	Get him out.	0
270	DONALD TRUMP	Don't hurt him.	0
271	DONALD TRUMP	See how nice I am?	0
272	DONALD TRUMP	I'm saying don't hurt him.	0
273	CHUCK TODD	--putting out a Wall Street Journal op-ed, promising to work closely with the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and top G.O.P.	0
274	CHUCK TODD	officials to reform our election policy, Trump himself shows no sign of letting up.	0
275	DONALD TRUMP	The Republican National Committee, they better get going.	0
276	DONALD TRUMP	Because I'll tell you what, you're going to have a rough July at that convention.	0
277	CHUCK TODD	But can Trump afford to alienate the party insiders he needs to unite the party and win a general election?	0
278	CHUCK TODD	He's already struggling with swing voters.	0
279	DONALD TRUMP	Who's going to pay for the wall?	0
280	CHUCK TODD	79% of Hispanic voters now view Trump unfavorably.	0
281	DONALD TRUMP	No, I'll use the word "anchor baby."	0
282	DONALD TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
283	DONALD TRUMP	I'll use the word "anchor baby."	0
284	CHUCK TODD	So do 67 percent of suburban women, and 72 percent of moderates.	0
285	MEGYN KELLY	You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.	0
286	MEGYN KELLY	Your Twitter account--	0
287	DONALD TRUMP	Only Rosie O'Donnell.	0
288	CHUCK TODD	Three years ago, after Mitt Romney's defeat, the party charted a path back to the White House that imagined a big-tent Republican party, and recommended new appeals to women and minority voters.	0
289	REINCE PRIEBUS	A welcoming attitude that we need to have in our party.	0
290	REINCE PRIEBUS	I think that we had some biologically stupid things that were said in the last election.	0
291	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)	0
292	CHUCK TODD	I'm joined now by the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.	0
293	CHUCK TODD	Chairman Priebus, welcome back to Meet the Press.	0
294	REINCE PRIEBUS	Good morning.	0
295	REINCE PRIEBUS	Thank you.	0
296	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with your Republican frontrunner continually calling the process that you're overseeing rigged.	0
297	CHUCK TODD	How do you tell Republican voters you are running a fair process when the frontrunner is calling what you're doing rigged?	0
298	REINCE PRIEBUS	You know, look, I don't know what the motivation is.	0
299	REINCE PRIEBUS	There's really nothing that's rigged or being changed or altered.	0
300	REINCE PRIEBUS	These are the same rules that were in place basically for over a century.	0
301	REINCE PRIEBUS	But at the very least, there's no way around the fact that all of these states submitted their delegate allocation plans by October 1st of 2015.	0
302	REINCE PRIEBUS	And not a single thing has changed about it.	0
303	REINCE PRIEBUS	These conventions that people talk about, number one, it's not common.	0
304	REINCE PRIEBUS	But a few states out West use a convention system where delegates start competing at the county level a month ago, and they go through the county, the precinct, the congressional district in a state convention.	0
305	REINCE PRIEBUS	And the candidates participate the whole way through.	0
306	REINCE PRIEBUS	And no one was complaining, except for when it was all over.	0
307	REINCE PRIEBUS	And look, every state is different.	0
308	REINCE PRIEBUS	And you can reform the system.	0
309	REINCE PRIEBUS	I mean, look, this has been an ongoing debate.	0
310	REINCE PRIEBUS	But you have to go state by state by state.	0
311	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's a pretty extraordinary task.	0
312	CHUCK TODD	How concerned are you when Donald Trump says, "The R.N.C.	0
313	CHUCK TODD	better be prepared for a rough July."	0
314	CHUCK TODD	And are you concerned about reports of threats being made to delegates?	0
315	CHUCK TODD	What do you say to any campaign doing that?	0
316	REINCE PRIEBUS	Well, sure, I mean, look, there's no room for threatening the delegates or the convention or anybody that would be going to our national convention.	0
317	REINCE PRIEBUS	But I also think some of this is rhetoric and hyperbole.	0
318	REINCE PRIEBUS	And the truth is, is that the delegates themselves are the ones that write the rules for the convention.	0
319	REINCE PRIEBUS	The R.N.C.	0
320	REINCE PRIEBUS	doesn't write any rules.	0
321	REINCE PRIEBUS	The R.N.C.	0
322	REINCE PRIEBUS	has basically an administrative role at the convention.	0
323	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's by majority rule, the delegates can run the convention.	0
324	REINCE PRIEBUS	So it's on them to decide what they want to do about a lot of these issues, not us.	0
325	CHUCK TODD	Who's picking this nominee?	0
326	CHUCK TODD	The voters or the delegates?	0
327	REINCE PRIEBUS	You know, I think it's a combination, but it's empowered by the voters.	0
328	REINCE PRIEBUS	So the voters empower the delegates.	0
329	REINCE PRIEBUS	But ultimately, the delegates who, in most cases are bound by the outcome of caucuses and primaries and conventions, make the decisions at the conventions.	0
330	REINCE PRIEBUS	Think about this, I think we lose sight of what the word "convention" means.	0
331	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's not a four-day party.	0
332	REINCE PRIEBUS	A convention, in its legal sense, is the members of the party coming together every four years to write the rules of the party, to elect officers of our party, and a nominee.	0
333	REINCE PRIEBUS	It has a legal value.	0
334	REINCE PRIEBUS	It's no different than when, like, you know, the boy scouts have a national convention.	0
335	REINCE PRIEBUS	They do similar things.	0
336	REINCE PRIEBUS	And that's what's happening.	0
337	REINCE PRIEBUS	But the media never covers the fact that we actually do a lot of business at the convention.	0
338	REINCE PRIEBUS	But now everyone's interested in this business of a national convention.	0
339	CHUCK TODD	Yes, they are.	0
340	CHUCK TODD	That's for sure.	0
341	CHUCK TODD	Look, we just have a brand new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll out.	0
342	CHUCK TODD	Among Republican voters, we asked this simple question who should be the winner.	0
343	CHUCK TODD	Should it be the candidate with the most primary votes, regardless of whether it's a majority, or the candidate who is the choice of the delegates.	0
344	CHUCK TODD	By two to one, Chairman Priebus, Republican voters say it's got to be the one who has the most primary votes.	0
345	CHUCK TODD	And that's going to be Donald Trump by a lot.	0
346	CHUCK TODD	What do you tell those voters if it's not Trump?	0
347	REINCE PRIEBUS	Well, look, if Donald Trump, if he was winning the majority of votes, he'd likely have the majority of delegates.	0
348	REINCE PRIEBUS	But that's not actually what's happening.	0
349	REINCE PRIEBUS	He's winning a plurality of votes, and he has a plurality of delegates.	0
350	REINCE PRIEBUS	And under the rules and under the concept of this country, a majority rules on everything.	0
351	REINCE PRIEBUS	Majority rules on the electoral college.	0
352	REINCE PRIEBUS	Majority rules at the D.N.C., at the R.N.C.	0
353	REINCE PRIEBUS	And I don't know too many places where majority doesn't rule.	0
354	REINCE PRIEBUS	And I would suppose that if people were asked a question like that, it makes sense, but it only tells you half the story.	0
355	CHUCK TODD	Very quick chariman-- very quick, I've got a couple of campaigns that are worried you're going to allow Trump to bully you.	0
356	CHUCK TODD	What do you say to that?	0
357	CHUCK TODD	Bully you and cave to his demands.	0
358	REINCE PRIEBUS	No, listen, the rules are set.	0
359	REINCE PRIEBUS	I've been pretty clear.	0
360	REINCE PRIEBUS	I think I've done more TV in the last two weeks than I have in two years, and it's because I'm not going to allow anyone to rewrite the rules of our party.	0
361	CHUCK TODD	All right.	0
362	CHUCK TODD	Chairman Priebus, thanks for coming on Meet the Press this morning, good to see you.	0
363	REINCE PRIEBUS	You bet.	0
364	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, check out this sign.	0
365	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to North Carolina.	0
366	CHUCK TODD	Due to our stance on LGBT rights, please set your clock back 100 years.	0
367	CHUCK TODD	Obviously a protest sign, and that of course refers to the bill that North Carolina's governor Pat McCrory signed into law, that many critics say discriminates against the LGBT community.	0
368	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory joins me next exclusively.	0
369	CHUCK TODD	North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has found himself on the frontlines of the latest battle for LGBT rights.	0
370	CHUCK TODD	Here’s what happened: the state’s largest city, Charlotte, passed an ordinance that prevented businesses from discriminating against lesbians, gays and transgender people.	0
371	CHUCK TODD	In response, Governor McCrory quickly signed into law a bill that’s being called by some, anti-gay -- the so-called “bathroom law.”	0
372	CHUCK TODD	The law does a few things.	0
373	CHUCK TODD	First, it invalidates the Charlotte ordinance and prevents other municipalities in the state from passing similar protections.	0
374	CHUCK TODD	Second, it requires that transgender people use the bathroom and locker room matching their birth-certificate gender, rather than the gender they identify with.	0
375	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory has been forced to defend and clarify the law's intent, which goes much further than just repealing the Charlotte ordinance.	0
376	CHUCK TODD	All while he faces a tough reelection fight this November, and the governor of North Carolina joins me now.	0
377	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory, welcome to Meet the Press.	0
378	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Thanks for having me.	0
379	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I appreciate it.	0
380	CHUCK TODD	Uh, since you signed the executive order, and it was intended to try, I think you were trying to ratchet back some of the controversy here, you still had more companies joining the boycott here, Bloomberg, Capital One, United Airlines, William Sonoma.	0
381	CHUCK TODD	That's just on Friday.	0
382	CHUCK TODD	160 companies have called for its repeal.	0
383	CHUCK TODD	You still have an NBA commissioner that is not yet committing to keeping the All-Star game in Charlotte.	0
384	CHUCK TODD	Any estimates we have of lost revenue so far, we have come up with calculated, conservative calculations, $39.7 million, $186 million perhaps in revenue, and some have suggested billions in lost revenue.	0
385	CHUCK TODD	All of this now, do you have regrets signing this law?	0
386	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I'm going to, as governor, as I did with mayor, I will always call out government overreach.	0
387	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And this example, the city of Charlotte, where I was mayor for 14 years, did government overreach.	0
388	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And what your pre-clip didn't mention was it was the left that brought about the bathroom bill, not the right in the city of Charlotte, like the city of Houston tried to do and was rejected by 61 percent of the vote.	0
389	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private sector employer in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the largest, 15th, 16th-largest cities in the United States of America.	0
390	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I think that's government overreach.	0
391	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower -- um -- practices should be.	0
392	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A.	0
393	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	and other non-profit organizations.	0
394	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And by the way, this is what 29 other states also do not have, these types of restroom, locker room, and bathroom policies.	0
395	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	So--	0
396	CHUCK TODD	But I thought, you know, you talked about overreach.	0
397	CHUCK TODD	Okay, you say Charlotte overreached.	0
398	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Right.	0
399	CHUCK TODD	How did the state of North Carolina, the state government, not overreach in just the same way.	0
400	CHUCK TODD	You mentioned Houston.	0
401	CHUCK TODD	Voters made that decision.	0
402	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Right.	0
403	CHUCK TODD	You can make a case, voters made the decision in Charlotte.	0
404	CHUCK TODD	Charlotte rejected it, then elected two new members of the city council.	0
405	CHUCK TODD	This has been a long debate in the city of Charlotte, this is where they came down.	0
406	CHUCK TODD	You guys debated for, like, ten seconds.	0
407	CHUCK TODD	I mean, don't you regret the time of debate?	0
408	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Actually, Charlotte's vote was a very little debate.	0
409	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	They just had a lot of public speakers speaking for and against--	0
410	CHUCK TODD	No, that night.	0
411	CHUCK TODD	But this has been months -- this has been months of a debate.	0
412	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Look, when Charlotte had originally turned it down, just like Houston has.	0
413	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And there hasn't been outrage, there wasn't outrage towards Charlotte when they turned it down initially.	0
414	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There was an outrage towards Houston, Texas, when they turned it down recently.	0
415	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But I tell you what I have learned through this, is we've got to have more dialogue and not threats.	0
416	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, I was in Hamlet, North Carolina, a small town that can be at any town in the United States of America.	0
417	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I walked into a buffet restaurant, African American buffet restaurant, and the people just welcomed me with open arms and said, "Thanks for protecting us."	0
418	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I got back in my car, and I got a call from someone in corporate America going, "Man, you've got to change this.	0
419	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We're getting killed."	0
420	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And it showed me the disconnect we have between the corporate suites and main street on a very complex subject, and a very personal subject regarding government policy of all things, which didn't exist before this group brought this up.	0
421	CHUCK TODD	It's a very thoughtful thing for you to say about dialogue.	0
422	CHUCK TODD	Where was the dialogue in this?	0
423	CHUCK TODD	I mean, first of all, you didn't--	0
424	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, let me tell you.	0
425	CHUCK TODD	Your legislature--	0
426	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I didn't want to--	0
427	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But legislature, to their defense--	0
428	CHUCK TODD	What dialogue?	0
429	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We had an April 1st deadline in which the Charlotte law was coming into effect.	0
430	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And they had to pass the law prior to--	0
431	CHUCK TODD	But you had said you weren't worried about that deadline.	0
432	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I wasn't.	0
433	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	The legislature, according to their lawyers, were, because they were afraid once it became into effect, it would be harder to overturn.	0
434	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And we can have the debate a longer time.	0
435	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a Y.M.C.A., for example.	0
436	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	However, in government, and I'm not going to tell the private sector any manufacturing plan, any bank can have their own policies.	0
437	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	NBC can have their own policy in Charlotte, North Carolina, or anywhere in North Carolina.	0
438	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But I do believe in our high schools, in our middle schools, in our universities, we should continue to have the tradition that we've been having in this country for years.	0
439	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And we have a women's facility and a men's facility.	0
440	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, it's worked out pretty well.	0
441	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I don't think we need any further government interference.	0
442	CHUCK TODD	But this, as we talked about, this law went further than that.	0
443	CHUCK TODD	It wiped away the city of Charlotte's ability to govern, to do some things on their own.	0
444	CHUCK TODD	For instance, they can't even have their own minimum wage now.	0
445	CHUCK TODD	Why'd you do that?	0
446	CHUCK TODD	Why'd you sign that?	0
447	CHUCK TODD	You're a former mayor of Charlotte.	0
448	CHUCK TODD	Could you accept all these limitations that big-state government has put on city and local control?	0
449	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I made a point when I was mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, we dealt with fire and police and airports and roads and light rail lines, we didn't impose new regulations on businesses.	0
450	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I don't think the government ought to be the H.R.	0
451	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director for every business, whether it be in Charlotte or whether it be in Greensboro or whether it be in Boone, North Carolina.	0
452	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And this is that fine line between how much does government tell the private sector in a regulatory way what to do, and in this case, a city which I still proudly call home, I think overstepped.	0
453	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And, you know, I've called out my own Republican legislature in the past, with magistrates and I've said no the magistrates need to marry after the Supreme Court case, and what the Supreme Court said.	0
454	CHUCK TODD	I understand that.	0
455	CHUCK TODD	But you didn't, you know, in your executive order, you didn't, and you're not calling for a passage of protecting gay North Carolinians from discrimination if they're fired in the private sector.	0
456	CHUCK TODD	Why?	0
457	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Because I'm not the private sector's H.R.	0
458	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director.	0
459	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I am the H.R.	0
460	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	director and the governor of all state employees.	0
461	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I signed an executive order which protects all state employees, in the ninth-largest state in United States of America, the same executive order that the Louisiana governor just signed, and got praised for it.	0
462	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I just happen to be a Republican governor, and I got criticized for doing the same thing.	0
463	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I have to say, there are a little bit of politics involved here.	0
464	CHUCK TODD	But with all due respect--	0
465	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Sure.	0
466	CHUCK TODD	Barry Goldwater had said this when they were debating whether to have the Civil Rights act, and debating whether government should be involved in dealing with racial discrimination.	0
467	CHUCK TODD	And he said, "I am unalterably opposed to discrimination of any sort.	0
468	CHUCK TODD	But not law that embodies features like these provisions which fly in the face of the constitution, and which require for their effective execution, the creation of a police state."	0
469	CHUCK TODD	The same argument was used to try to defeat laws that would -- are now considered untouchable, right?	0
470	CHUCK TODD	Laws that protect minorities from discrimination in the private sector.	0
471	CHUCK TODD	Why don't gays and lesbians qualify?	0
472	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I don’t -- first of all, I don't know of any business right now in North Carolina, and very similar to what Nikki Haley said about South Carolina, that is doing this.	0
473	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But at the same time, what we've got to do is deal with this extremely new social norm that has come to our nation at a very quick period of time, and have these discussions about the complexity of equality while also balancing the concept of privacy, including even privacy in the most private of areas of our life, which is a restroom, locker room, or shower facility in our high schools.	0
474	CHUCK TODD	But gender identity is the same privacy.	0
475	CHUCK TODD	It's the same issue --	0
476	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, now, the folks that are-- if that’s the case --	0
477	CHUCK TODD	It's dealing with that same privacy.	0
478	CHUCK TODD	I mean, do you want somebody who identifies as a woman, born on their birth certificate as a man, may look like a woman, going into a men's bathroom?	0
479	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	All I'd say is we have 27 states--	0
480	CHUCK TODD	Is that fair to them?	0
481	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We have 27 states, not just -- this is not just a North Carolina debate.	0
482	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is a national debate that's just come on in literally the last three months.	0
483	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	No one had heard of this debate until the Houston ordinance was defeated by the people of Houston.	0
484	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	We have 27 to 29 states that also don't have this type of mandate on private business, including the state of New York.	0
485	CHUCK TODD	I'm curious about due diligence.	0
486	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Sure.	0
487	CHUCK TODD	Did you meet with any transgender people?	0
488	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I have.	0
489	CHUCK TODD	Before you signed that law?	0
490	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Not with -- but I’ve met with transgender people in the past, and I've met with them since, and have had very positive conversations.	0
491	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Now the conversation with a very powerful group called the Human Relations, uh, Human Rights Council, my gosh, they're more powerful than the N.R.A., and they have millions of dollars, which makes me want to overturn United, ‘cause I don't know who their donors are either.	0
492	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	But they are putting on a lot of pressure, instead of having good dialogue.	0
493	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And I had wonderful dialogue with a transgender woman who was, and we talked about each other's issues.	0
494	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There's passion on each side of this issue.	0
495	CHUCK TODD	All right, but does it bother you at all though, Georgia defeated it, South Carolina--	0
496	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Wait a minute.	0
497	CHUCK TODD	Does it bother you at all that basically North Carolina and Mississippi is the only other state to side with you on this.	0
498	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Well, let me correct you.	0
499	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Georgia and Mississippi was religious freedom bill.	0
500	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This was not a religious freedom bill.	0
501	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	In fact, we have not had any religious freedom bill introduced in the state of North Carolina.	0
502	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	One reason is because I'm governor.	0
503	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	So the confusion by the national media and The New York Times of the Indiana religious freedom bill, Mississippi, and Georgia religious freedom bill, that's not the case.	0
504	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is basically a restroom privacy issue, versus equality.	0
505	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And these things need to be discussed, not threatened by Hollywood or anyone.	0
506	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	You know, Hollywood, with all due respects to the Hollywood, the new Batman and Robin movie is playing in China, which has anti-gay, terrible, terrible human rights violations.	0
507	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	This is not like an issue of bathroom privacy or restroom privacy in North Carolina.	0
508	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And let's have this dialogue and I welcome that dialogue.	0
509	CHUCK TODD	All right, Governor McCrory, is there any way this gets repealed?	0
510	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	I don't think the restroom, I do believe that--	0
511	CHUCK TODD	But you'll repeal other parts of this bill?	0
512	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	There is one part of the bill that I do disagree with, where I signed it, and that is you're not able to sue within state courts.	0
513	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	And that needs to be repealed.	0
514	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	It was very poorly thought out.	0
515	CHUCK TODD	All right, we'll be watching for more.	0
516	CHUCK TODD	Governor McCrory--	0
517	GOV. PAT MCCRORY	Thanks for bringing me here, appreciate it.	0
518	CHUCK TODD	Appreciate it.	0
519	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, we'll have much more on the 2016 race.	0
520	CHUCK TODD	And then there was this, last night on S.N.L.	0
521	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)	0
522	LARRY DAVID	Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.	0
523	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	What?	0
524	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	No, no, you can't "yada yada" at--	0
525	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)	0
526	CHUCK TODD	When we come back the Republican party has 31 governorships, the most senators since 2005 and the most members of the House since the Hoover presidency.	0
527	CHUCK TODD	So why does it seem the party has the death wish when it comes to trying to win the White House?	0
528	CHUCK TODD	Panel is back, we’re going to discuss the Republican presidential race, we’ve got a lot going on in this show.	0
529	CHUCK TODD	Hugh Hewitt, Reince Priebus is trying very hard to claim that the process is not rigged.	0
530	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump is trying very hard to paint it as rigged.	0
531	CHUCK TODD	Who has got the better PR case?	0
532	HUGH HEWITT	RNC has the better facts as Reince Priebus pointed out in your interview.	0
533	HUGH HEWITT	They have instructed the committee this week not to make any rule changes.	0
534	HUGH HEWITT	Any rule changes will be done by the delegates themselves.	0
535	HUGH HEWITT	Look, Donald Trump does very well building skyscrapers ,not building state delegation majorities.	0
536	HUGH HEWITT	He got beat in Georgia last night, cue Vicki Lawrence the night the lights went out in Georgia, I think the Cruz campaign has won twelve consecutive victories over five states, including delegations.	0
537	CHUCK TODD	I’ll put up a little graphic right now actually we put together.	0
538	CHUCK TODD	He has beaten on delegates 2 to 1 since March 22nd.	0
539	CHUCK TODD	He’s netted 66 but guess what, that advantage is erased on Tuesday with New York.	0
540	HUGH HEWITT	Trump is coming back because Ivanka has returned to the trail.	0
541	HUGH HEWITT	I think she is a tremendous, there is a piece in the New York Times this morning by Jonathan Moller, on how she is poised and disciplined and bringing that to her father’s campaign.	0
542	HUGH HEWITT	So the solution here is a fusion ticket Cruz Trump but Ivanka is the Vice President.	0
543	CHRIS MATTHEWS	That’s insanity.	0
544	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Let me tell you, Trump has got the same trump card that Bernie has-- democracy.	0
545	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Ever since at least since the Kennedy-Humphrey fight over the nomination in Wisconsin and West Virginia.	0
546	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Certainly through Reagan against Bush, certainly Obama against Hillary.	0
547	CHRIS MATTHEWS	We watched the primaries to see who the nominee is and now we’re told don’t watch the primaries anymore, there’s this thing at the convention with the rules and you have to have a majority vote.	0
548	CHRIS MATTHEWS	The numbers do show overwhelmingly, the Republican people believe in democracy and Trump makes that case.	0
549	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Bernie makes it against the billionaires and Citizens United and it’s the same argument, the people should vote.	0
550	CHUCK TODD	You know the problem Perry, is the political parties modeled their nominating process after the electoral college which, by the way, isn’t one person one vote either.	0
551	CHUCK TODD	PERRY BACON JR.	0
552	CHUCK TODD	But I think Trump has had a really good week in making this argument.	0
553	CHUCK TODD	If you look at, we have these primaries for a reason and they’re not for fun.	0
554	CHUCK TODD	The idea is that they matter to some extent.	0
555	CHUCK TODD	I disagree with Chris a little bit in that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are winning the most delegates and the most states.	0
556	CHUCK TODD	And I think that for most people that’s who the winner is and I think Reince has got to make a better argument than the rules are the rules are the rules.	0
557	CHRIS MATTHEWS	How do you disagree with me?	0
558	CHRIS MATTHEWS	PERRY BACON JR.	0
559	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Because Chris, because Hillary Clinton not Bernie Sanders is the one winning the primary so I don’t think democracy is for…	0
560	CHRIS MATTHEWS	No I said the rhetorical argument is for one man one vote.	0
561	CHUCK TODD	They have the same rhetorical argument, yes.	0
562	KATHLEEN PARKER	For the record I agree with Chris on that because it is a good argument.	0
563	KATHLEEN PARKER	Look we care about people's’ votes right, oh no not really.	0
564	KATHLEEN PARKER	But I think Trump is actually going to have a very good week and, actually a couple of really good weeks, because he’s obviously going to take New York.	0
565	KATHLEEN PARKER	He’s predicted to get 85 to 90 of the 95 delegates and the leftovers are out in Staten Island and who knows.	0
566	KATHLEEN PARKER	But, you know, after that he goes out to Pennsylvania and Maryland and on and on and Indiana going in so he’s going to build some fresh momentum and I think that’s going to make a difference.	0
567	CHUCK TODD	By the way guys we’ve got more of our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, a little taste of it.	0
568	CHUCK TODD	Maybe it doesn’t surprise people, but the two most popular presidential candidates by the American public overall are John Kasich and Bernie Sanders.,	0
569	KATHLEEN PARKER	Right.	0
570	KATHLEEN PARKER	Because they’re good people	0
571	CHUCK TODD	The lowest negative rating among all Republican candidates is Kasich. Look at that.	0
572	CHUCK TODD	Trump’s at 65 percent negative rating among all voters, Ted Cruz at 49 percent.	0
573	CHUCK TODD	Hugh Hewitt, those are tough numbers man.	0
574	CHUCK TODD	And by the way let me put up Hillary Clinton, 56 percent negative rating.	0
575	CHUCK TODD	Again, Sanders-Kasich is what the people want apparently.	0
576	HUGH HEWITT	Parties are continuing bodies, they are not the public.	0
577	HUGH HEWITT	They stand for an ideological set of principles.	0
578	HUGH HEWITT	I was at the Republican Jewish committee in Nevada where Ted Cruz got four standing ovations from a decidedly not ideologically strong conservative.	0
579	HUGH HEWITT	I believe he’s going to be the nominee because he is more consistently with the ideological spectrum that is the continuing Republican party.	0
580	HUGH HEWITT	Donald Trump’s had a good week, Kathleen’s right he's going to have a good couple of weeks.	0
581	HUGH HEWITT	He ain’t getting close to 1237.	0
582	CHUCK TODD	Wow.	0
583	CHRIS MATTHEWS	He’s going to win.	0
584	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Trump will be the nominee, probably for the opposite reason you say.	0
585	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Why is every conservative radio guy basically for Cruz?	0
586	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Explain the culture to me.	0
587	HUGH HEWITT	Actually, they’re not.	0
588	HUGH HEWITT	They’re all over the place--	0
589	CHRIS MATTHEWS	It’s overwhelming--	0
590	HUGH HEWITT	The only guy who’s come out actually, formally, is Mark Levin.	0
591	HUGH HEWITT	Who has an enormous-- And I’m very neutral, I’m completely--	0
592	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You are?	0
593	HUGH HEWITT	I’m Switzerland.	0
594	HUGH HEWITT	I don’t endorse anyone	0
595	CHUCK TODD	No and he’s been-- You said if Trump’s the nominee you said you’d support him.	0
596	HUGH HEWITT	I said I’d support him.	0
597	CHRIS MATTHEWS	All I hear is radio talk for Cruz.	0
598	HUGH HEWITT	You’ve gotta listen.	0
599	HUGH HEWITT	Only on Mark Levin is he strong that way.	0
600	HUGH HEWITT	But I will say, those in the local markets who are long-term ideological conservatives, like Charlie Sykes in Wisconsin, like Ted Cruz because of his policies.	0
601	PERRY BACON JR.	I want to add, I thought after Wisconsin maybe Ted Cruz was starting to get more popular among moderate Republicans.	0
602	PERRY BACON JR.	And the polls are showing Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Ted Cruz is not broadening his coalition and that’s a problem.	0
603	PERRY BACON JR.	He’s not really doing as well as he should.	0
604	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen, very quickly, I think New York Values kneecapped him--	0
605	KATHLEEN PARKER	Totally.	0
606	CHUCK TODD	And he couldn’t figure out a way out of it.	0
607	KATHLEEN PARKER	No, you can’t get out of it.	0
608	KATHLEEN PARKER	I mean, I think he’s eating alone in a fried chicken joint in the Bronx	0
609	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
610	CHUCK TODD	I think now the Cruz campaign wishes they said, hey, New York is yours Trump, we are going to camp out in Indiana and Pennsylvania.	0
611	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Remember the guy who did that before, Gary Hart he’s eating L.A. with a gay group, and he’s sort of making fun of New Jersey aesthetically.	0
612	CHRIS MATTHEWS	I’m sure glad I’m here and not New Jersey in some solid waste dump.	0
613	CHUCK TODD	And guess what happened?	0
614	CHUCK TODD	New Jersey's delegates went to Walter Mondale, and he was the nominee.	0
615	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Right.	0
616	CHUCK TODD	Quick programming note, we're going to take a quick break here.	0
617	CHUCK TODD	A quick programming note, my colleague Lester Holt's going to be anchoring Nightly News live from the Middle East tomorrow, and with it, he'll have an exclusive interview with the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter.	0
618	CHUCK TODD	Remember, there are serious issues that we are facing besides the way we argue about this election.	0
619	CHUCK TODD	And when we come back in 45 seconds, we'll have Endgame and the debate over the so-called "bathroom law” in North Carolina.	0
620	CHUCK TODD	Endgame time.	0
621	CHUCK TODD	Panel is here.	0
622	CHUCK TODD	Obviously I had Governor McCrory on earlier.	0
623	CHUCK TODD	Kathleen Parker, you and he sparred via column.	0
624	CHUCK TODD	You had a column that hit him pretty hard.	0
625	CHUCK TODD	He did a letter to the editor hitting back at your column.	0
626	KATHLEEN PARKER	And we may not make up.	0
627	CHUCK TODD	Good to hear.	0
628	CHUCK TODD	What did you make of the governor’s response?	0
629	KATHLEEN PARKER	Well, besides the fact that Governor's from Ohio, he's certainly mastered the southern arts of sweet talk and finesse.	0
630	KATHLEEN PARKER	You know, the fact of the matter, as you pointed out, there is still in place this prohibition that local municipalities can have their own anti -- sorry -- discrimination laws.	0
631	KATHLEEN PARKER	Now he's backing off of that now, and I think calling it more or less it was hasty, poor writing, crafting of the bill.	0
632	KATHLEEN PARKER	And so that's good.	0
633	KATHLEEN PARKER	I give him credit for that.	0
634	KATHLEEN PARKER	But still, you're allowing, the state is allowing private businesses, for example, to say, "I'm sorry, but we don't serve gays here."	0
635	KATHLEEN PARKER	Or, "We don't let gay people spend the night in our hotels."	0
636	KATHLEEN PARKER	You know, there's no recourse for those people, because unless these municipalities can pass their own anti-discrimination laws, then, you know, they're out of luck.	0
637	KATHLEEN PARKER	But on the bathroom bill, this to me seems to be such a bogus issue all together.	0
638	KATHLEEN PARKER	I don't know what they're afraid of, you know?	0
639	KATHLEEN PARKER	It's not as though you're going to have-- on the one hand, I'll hear from readers in North Carolina say, "So in other words, you, Kathleen Parker, think that perverts, men, ought to be able to come into bathrooms and assault ten-year-old girls," right?	0
640	KATHLEEN PARKER	So they're being fed some kind of crazy false narrative about what this is.	0
641	CHRIS MATTHEWS	The crazy thing is, this is nanny state at its worst, if you think about it.	0
642	CHRIS MATTHEWS	Where do they want the transsexuals to go?	0
643	CHRIS MATTHEWS	If someone identifies, dresses, looks like a woman, that person shows up in a men's room at National Reagan Airport.	0
644	CHRIS MATTHEWS	What happens then?	0
645	CHRIS MATTHEWS	I mean, if you follow the law the governor signed, what goes on then?	0
646	CHRIS MATTHEWS	You know, confusion and everything and probably a lot of disruption.	0
647	CHUCK TODD	Hugh, you know, one thing that I'm going to point out here is that, I don't know if this is true or not, but this yet another Republican governor that I feel as if his legislature did something that maybe he didn't want to do, and he felt as if he had no choice but to sign the legislation.	0
648	CHUCK TODD	Do you think that's at work here?	0
649	HUGH HEWITT	It's possible.	0
650	HUGH HEWITT	I mean, he did very well in his interview.	0
651	HUGH HEWITT	He leaned into the problem, quoting Chris Matthew, "Hang a lantern on your problem," showing up at Meet the Press on the Sunday after the controversy is very smart.	0
652	HUGH HEWITT	He'll probably be reelected.	0
653	HUGH HEWITT	But this is not the terrain the Republican party wants to fight this election on.	0
654	HUGH HEWITT	Going back to your Clooney interview, and by the way, I thought he was a better Batman than Ben Affleck at least, so--	0
655	CHUCK TODD	The bathroom debate and batman debate here today, okay.	0
656	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue about campaign financing.	0
657	KATHLEEN PARKER	Absolutely, Michael Keaton.	0
658	HUGH HEWITT	I want to point out that Charles Koch lives in Wichita, Kansas, in the same house that he has since 1974.	0
659	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue that Tom Steiner is trying to buy.	0
660	HUGH HEWITT	I don't want to argue about bathroom bills.	0
661	HUGH HEWITT	I want to argue about ISIS and Libya going downhill.	0
662	HUGH HEWITT	This is not our terrain.	0
663	HUGH HEWITT	We should not fight.	0
664	CHUCK TODD	You know I heard somebody say to me, Perry Bacon?	0
665	CHUCK TODD	This is what happens because Republicans overdid it on redistricting.	0
666	CHUCK TODD	And so yes, these folks are listening to their constituents, but only their constituents.	0
667	CHUCK TODD	Almost a narrow band of them.	0
668	KATHLEEN PARKER	That’s right.	0
669	PERRY BACON	I'm not sure in this case that’s even true.	0
670	PERRY BACON	As you pointed out though Georgia, South Carolina, Nikki Haley said, "We're not doing that law here."	0
671	PERRY BACON	She was very explicit about that.	0
672	PERRY BACON	I just think the Governor of North Carolina, the legislature missed the boat here.	0
673	PERRY BACON	He used the phrase "changing social norms."	0
674	PERRY BACON	He's right.	0
675	PERRY BACON	People who are transgender are more accepted today.	0
676	PERRY BACON	Last year was a big year for gay rights.	0
677	PERRY BACON	I just think he might have, you know, you asked him, "Have you talked to anyone who was transgender before this bill passed?"	0
678	PERRY BACON	And he all but said, "No."	0
679	PERRY BACON	I just think he made a political mistake here without sort of thinking through the contours of the issue.	0
680	PERRY BACON	Any time you have to send an executive order to a bill you signed three weeks before, you probably didn't think about it through the first time very carefully.	0
681	CHUCK TODD	Alright.	0
682	CHUCK TODD	Let's lighten things up a little bit, besides our Batman debate.	0
683	CHUCK TODD	Before we go, last night's S.N.L.	0
684	CHUCK TODD	was a real treat for Seinfeld fans, which by the way now we're getting two decades old.	0
685	CHUCK TODD	With Larry David as Bernie Sanders encountering Julia Louis Dreyfus's Elaine.	0
686	CHUCK TODD	Take a look.	0
687	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)	0
688	LARRY DAVID	Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.	0
689	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	What?	0
690	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	No, no, you can't "yada yada" at a debate.	0
691	JULIA LOUIS DREYFUS	Also, you "yada yada'd" over the best part.	0
692	LARRY DAVID	No, I mentioned the schvitz.	0
693	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)	0
694	CHUCK TODD	That's all we have today.	0
695	CHUCK TODD	I'm going to go have some lobster bisque.	0
696	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back next week.	0
697	CHUCK TODD	Because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
