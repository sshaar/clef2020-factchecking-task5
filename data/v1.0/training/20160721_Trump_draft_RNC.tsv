1	TRUMP	Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.	0
2	TRUMP	Story Continued Below Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.	0
3	TRUMP	We will be a country of generosity and warmth.	0
4	TRUMP	But we will also be a country of law and order.	0
5	TRUMP	Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.	0
6	TRUMP	The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.	0
7	TRUMP	Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.	0
8	TRUMP	Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.	0
9	TRUMP	Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.	0
10	TRUMP	I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.	0
11	TRUMP	Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.	0
12	TRUMP	The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.	0
13	TRUMP	Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.	0
14	TRUMP	It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.	0
15	TRUMP	I will present the facts plainly and honestly.	0
16	TRUMP	We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.	0
17	TRUMP	So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.	0
18	TRUMP	But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.	0
19	TRUMP	We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.	0
20	TRUMP	Trump speech draft leaks hours in advance By NICK GASS These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.	1
21	TRUMP	Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities.	1
22	TRUMP	That’s the largest increase in 25 years.	1
23	TRUMP	In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.	0
24	TRUMP	They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.	0
25	TRUMP	In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone.	0
26	TRUMP	And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.	0
27	TRUMP	The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.	0
28	TRUMP	Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.	1
29	TRUMP	The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.	1
30	TRUMP	They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.	0
31	TRUMP	One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.	0
32	TRUMP	There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.	0
33	TRUMP	She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.	0
34	TRUMP	Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.	0
35	TRUMP	I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family.	0
36	TRUMP	But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting.	0
37	TRUMP	One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.	0
38	TRUMP	What about our economy?	0
39	TRUMP	Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed.	0
40	TRUMP	2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago.	1
41	TRUMP	Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.	0
42	TRUMP	Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.	1
43	TRUMP	Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year.	1
44	TRUMP	The budget is no better.	0
45	TRUMP	President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.	0
46	TRUMP	Yet, what do we have to show for it?	0
47	TRUMP	Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.	1
48	TRUMP	Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.	0
49	TRUMP	Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.	0
50	TRUMP	We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.	0
51	TRUMP	This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.	0
52	TRUMP	Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.	0
53	TRUMP	In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.	0
54	TRUMP	America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.	0
55	TRUMP	I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.	0
56	TRUMP	Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today.	0
57	TRUMP	Let’s review the record.	0
58	TRUMP	In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.	1
59	TRUMP	Libya was cooperating.	0
60	TRUMP	Egypt was peaceful.	0
61	TRUMP	Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.	0
62	TRUMP	Iran was being choked by sanctions.	0
63	TRUMP	Syria was under control.	0
64	TRUMP	After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?	0
65	TRUMP	ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.	0
66	TRUMP	Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.	0
67	TRUMP	Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.	0
68	TRUMP	Iraq is in chaos.	0
69	TRUMP	Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.	0
70	TRUMP	Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.	0
71	TRUMP	After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.	0
72	TRUMP	This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.	0
73	TRUMP	But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.	0
74	TRUMP	The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.	0
75	TRUMP	A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes.	0
76	TRUMP	Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.	0
77	TRUMP	The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.	0
78	TRUMP	Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.	0
79	TRUMP	As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.	0
80	TRUMP	This will all change in 2017.	0
81	TRUMP	The American People will come first once again.	0
82	TRUMP	My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.	0
83	TRUMP	There can be no prosperity without law and order.	0
84	TRUMP	On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.	0
85	TRUMP	A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests.	0
86	TRUMP	That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.	0
87	TRUMP	Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.	0
88	TRUMP	They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.	0
89	TRUMP	She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.	0
90	TRUMP	That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change.	0
91	TRUMP	My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.	0
92	TRUMP	Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.	0
93	TRUMP	I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.	0
94	TRUMP	These are the forgotten men and women of our country.	0
95	TRUMP	People who work hard but no longer have a voice.	0
96	TRUMP	I AM YOUR VOICE.	0
97	TRUMP	I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.	0
98	TRUMP	I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.	0
99	TRUMP	When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.	0
100	TRUMP	And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.	0
101	TRUMP	When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.	0
102	TRUMP	They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.	0
103	TRUMP	In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly.	0
104	TRUMP	When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.	0
105	TRUMP	I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.	0
106	TRUMP	Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.	0
107	TRUMP	I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.	0
108	TRUMP	But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade.	0
109	TRUMP	Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.	0
110	TRUMP	In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.	0
111	TRUMP	We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.	0
112	TRUMP	He is a man of character and accomplishment.	0
113	TRUMP	He is the right man for the job.	0
114	TRUMP	The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.	0
115	TRUMP	America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed.	0
116	TRUMP	In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.	0
117	TRUMP	Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.	0
118	TRUMP	On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.	0
119	TRUMP	Three were killed, and four were badly injured.	0
120	TRUMP	An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.	0
121	TRUMP	I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.	0
122	TRUMP	Leaked document: Trump will tell the nation, 'I am your voice' By ELI STOKOLS and NICK GASS I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done.	0
123	TRUMP	In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.	0
124	TRUMP	The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.	0
125	TRUMP	This Administration has failed America’s inner cities.	0
126	TRUMP	It’s failed them on education.	0
127	TRUMP	It’s failed them on jobs.	0
128	TRUMP	It’s failed them on crime.	0
129	TRUMP	It’s failed them at every level.	0
130	TRUMP	When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.	0
131	TRUMP	Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?	0
132	TRUMP	To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.	0
133	TRUMP	Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.	0
134	TRUMP	Men, women and children viciously mowed down.	0
135	TRUMP	Lives ruined.	0
136	TRUMP	Families ripped apart.	0
137	TRUMP	A nation in mourning.	0
138	TRUMP	The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.	0
139	TRUMP	Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist.	0
140	TRUMP	This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community.	0
141	TRUMP	As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.	0
142	TRUMP	To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.	0
143	TRUMP	We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world.	0
144	TRUMP	We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.	0
145	TRUMP	Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.	0
146	TRUMP	This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.	0
147	TRUMP	Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.	0
148	TRUMP	My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.	1
149	TRUMP	She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.	1
150	TRUMP	I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.	0
151	TRUMP	Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.	0
152	TRUMP	Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.	0
153	TRUMP	We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.	0
154	TRUMP	On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.	0
155	TRUMP	They are just three brave representatives of many thousands.	0
156	TRUMP	Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.	0
157	TRUMP	These families have no special interests to represent them.	0
158	TRUMP	There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.	0
159	TRUMP	My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.	0
160	TRUMP	Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.	1
161	TRUMP	But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle?	0
162	TRUMP	Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?	0
163	TRUMP	Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?	0
164	TRUMP	These wounded American families have been alone.	0
165	TRUMP	But they are alone no longer.	0
166	TRUMP	Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.	0
167	TRUMP	We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.	0
168	TRUMP	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.	0
169	TRUMP	By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence.	0
170	TRUMP	Illegal border crossings will go down.	0
171	TRUMP	Peace will be restored.	0
172	TRUMP	By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.	0
173	TRUMP	Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.	0
174	TRUMP	On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.	0
175	TRUMP	We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.	0
176	TRUMP	But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.	0
177	TRUMP	My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.	0
178	TRUMP	Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.	0
179	TRUMP	Communities want relief.	0
180	TRUMP	Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.	0
181	TRUMP	Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.	0
182	TRUMP	I have a different vision for our workers.	0
183	TRUMP	It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.	0
184	TRUMP	It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.	0
185	TRUMP	I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again.	0
186	TRUMP	I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones.	0
187	TRUMP	America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.	1
188	TRUMP	Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.	0
189	TRUMP	Never again.	0
190	TRUMP	I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.	0
191	TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.	0
192	TRUMP	She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.	0
193	TRUMP	She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea.	0
194	TRUMP	She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
195	TRUMP	The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.	0
196	TRUMP	I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.	0
197	TRUMP	Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.	0
198	TRUMP	No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.	0
199	TRUMP	We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.	0
200	TRUMP	This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.	0
201	TRUMP	Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated.	0
202	TRUMP	That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want.	0
203	TRUMP	We are going to start building and making things again.	0
204	TRUMP	Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.	0
205	TRUMP	While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican.	1
206	TRUMP	Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.	1
207	TRUMP	America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.	1
208	TRUMP	Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.	0
209	TRUMP	Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all.	0
210	TRUMP	Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it.	0
211	TRUMP	We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.	0
212	TRUMP	This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.	0
213	TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President.	0
214	TRUMP	With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.	0
215	TRUMP	This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.	0
216	TRUMP	This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.	0
217	TRUMP	We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.	0
218	TRUMP	My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children.	0
219	TRUMP	We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.	0
220	TRUMP	You will be able to choose your own doctor again.	0
221	TRUMP	And we will fix TSA at the airports!	0
222	TRUMP	We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.	0
223	TRUMP	We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.	0
224	TRUMP	My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is.	0
225	TRUMP	We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.	0
226	TRUMP	The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it.	0
227	TRUMP	We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.	0
228	TRUMP	The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles.	0
229	TRUMP	This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.	0
230	TRUMP	My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.	1
231	TRUMP	I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.	0
232	TRUMP	At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive.	0
233	TRUMP	You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.	0
234	TRUMP	An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.	1
235	TRUMP	I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.	0
236	TRUMP	We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.	0
237	TRUMP	It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.	0
238	TRUMP	In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.	0
239	TRUMP	My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew.	0
240	TRUMP	I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.	0
241	TRUMP	It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.	0
242	TRUMP	He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.	0
243	TRUMP	Then there’s my mother, Mary.	0
244	TRUMP	She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded.	0
245	TRUMP	She was a truly great mother.	0
246	TRUMP	She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.	0
247	TRUMP	To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.	0
248	TRUMP	I have loved my life in business.	0
249	TRUMP	But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you.	0
250	TRUMP	It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people.	0
251	TRUMP	But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.	0
252	TRUMP	America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.	0
253	TRUMP	Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight.	0
254	TRUMP	No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.	0
255	TRUMP	Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.	0
256	TRUMP	History is watching us now.	0
257	TRUMP	It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.	0
258	TRUMP	My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge.	0
259	TRUMP	It reads: “I’m With Her”.	0
260	TRUMP	I choose to recite a different pledge.	0
