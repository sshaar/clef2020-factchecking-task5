1	Mike Pence	Good afternoon.	0
2	Mike Pence	Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, members of congress, distinguished guests, on behalf of the first family, welcome to the White House.	0
3	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
4	Mike Pence	You know it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every day to make America great again.	0
5	Mike Pence	Since the first day of this administration President Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.	0
6	Mike Pence	President Trump has been reforming healthcare, enforcing our laws, ending illegal immigration, rebuilding our military and this president has been rolling back excessive regulations and unfair trade practices that were stifling American jobs.	0
7	Mike Pence	Thanks to President Trump's leadership, American businesses are growing again, investing in America again, and they're creating jobs in this country instead of shipping jobs overseas.	0
8	Mike Pence	Thanks to President Donald Trump, America is back.	0
9	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
10	Mike Pence	And just last week, we all witnessed the bold leadership of an American president on the world stage putting America first.	0
11	Mike Pence	From the Middle East to Europe as leader of the free world, President Trump reaffirmed historic alliances, forged new relationships, and called on the wider world to confront the threat of terrorism in new and renewed ways.	0
12	Mike Pence	And by the action the president will announce today, the American people and the wider world will see once again our president is choosing to put American jobs and American consumers first.	0
13	Mike Pence	Our president is choosing to put American energy and American industry first.	0
14	Mike Pence	And by his action today, President Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first. So with gratitude for his leadership...	0
15	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
16	Mike Pence	... and admiration for his unwavering commitment to the American people, it is now my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you the president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.	0
17	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
18	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
19	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
20	Donald Trump	I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.	0
21	Donald Trump	We're closely monitoring the situation.	0
22	Donald Trump	And I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time, but it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror.	0
23	Donald Trump	Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.	0
24	Donald Trump	Before we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous, absolutely tremendous economic progress since election day on November 8th.	0
25	Donald Trump	The economy is starting to come back and very, very rapidly.	0
26	Donald Trump	We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.	0
27	Donald Trump	I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.	0
28	Donald Trump	It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.	0
29	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
30	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
31	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
32	Donald Trump	In my meetings at the G-7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.	0
33	Donald Trump	We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.	0
34	Donald Trump	Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that -- you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.	0
35	Donald Trump	Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contributions.	0
36	Donald Trump	One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president, whether it's cutting job- killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one, until this point, thought even possible.	0
37	Donald Trump	And believe me, we've just begun.	0
38	Donald Trump	The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.	0
39	Donald Trump	On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments, and I don't want anything to get in our way.	0
40	Donald Trump	I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord...	0
41	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
42	Donald Trump	... thank you.	0
43	Donald Trump	Thank you -- but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an -- really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.	0
44	Donald Trump	So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.	0
45	Donald Trump	And if we can, that's great.	0
46	Donald Trump	And if we can't, that's fine.	0
47	Donald Trump	As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.	0
48	Donald Trump	The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production.	0
49	Donald Trump	Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.	0
50	Donald Trump	This includes ending the implementation of the nationally-determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.	0
51	Donald Trump	Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.	0
52	Donald Trump	This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need.	0
53	Donald Trump	Believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely -- they rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.	0
54	Donald Trump	According to the same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper, down 12 percent; cement, down 23 percent; iron and steel, down 38 percent; coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86 percent; natural gas, down 31 percent.	0
55	Donald Trump	The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have 7,000 less income, and in many cases, much worse than that.	0
56	Donald Trump	Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.	0
57	Donald Trump	As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscious support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does.	0
58	Donald Trump	The world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.	0
59	Donald Trump	For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13.	1
60	Donald Trump	They can do whatever they want for 13 years.	0
61	Donald Trump	Not us.	0
62	Donald Trump	India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.	0
63	Donald Trump	There are many other examples.	0
64	Donald Trump	But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.	0
65	Donald Trump	Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does.	0
66	Donald Trump	And the mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.	0
67	Donald Trump	A big opening of a brand, new mine.	0
68	Donald Trump	It's unheard of.	0
69	Donald Trump	For many, many years that hasn't happened.	0
70	Donald Trump	They asked me if I'd go.	0
71	Donald Trump	I'm going to try.	0
72	Donald Trump	China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.	0
73	Donald Trump	So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.	0
74	Donald Trump	India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.	0
75	Donald Trump	Think of it.	0
76	Donald Trump	India can double their coal production.	0
77	Donald Trump	We're supposed to get rid of ours.	0
78	Donald Trump	Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.	0
79	Donald Trump	In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs.	0
80	Donald Trump	It just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.	0
81	Donald Trump	This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.	0
82	Donald Trump	The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement.	0
83	Donald Trump	They went wild.	0
84	Donald Trump	They were so happy.	0
85	Donald Trump	For the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.	0
86	Donald Trump	A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.	0
87	Donald Trump	We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.	0
88	Donald Trump	We have among the most abundant energy reserves in the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty.	0
89	Donald Trump	Yet under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation, great wealth, phenomenal wealth.	0
90	Donald Trump	Not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth.	0
91	Donald Trump	And leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.	0
92	Donald Trump	The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.	0
93	Donald Trump	At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand. But at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country...	0
94	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
95	Donald Trump	... will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts.	0
96	Donald Trump	Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases.	0
97	Donald Trump	And the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.	0
98	Donald Trump	Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree - think of that, this much - Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.	0
99	Donald Trump	Tiny - tiny amount.	0
100	Donald Trump	In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is an incredible statistic - would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030.	0
101	Donald Trump	After we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.	0
102	Donald Trump	As "The Wall Street Journal" wrote, this morning, "The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate.	0
103	Donald Trump	The United States under the Trump Administration will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on earth."	0
104	Donald Trump	We'll be the cleanest.	0
105	Donald Trump	We're going to have the cleanest air.	0
106	Donald Trump	We're going to have the cleanest water.	0
107	Donald Trump	We will be environmentally friendly but we're not going to put our businesses out of work, we're not going to lose our jobs.	0
108	Donald Trump	We're going to grow.	0
109	Donald Trump	We're going to grow rapidly.	0
110	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
111	Donald Trump	And I think you just read - it just came out minutes ago the small business report.	0
112	Donald Trump	Small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people, one of the best reports they've seen in many years.	0
113	Donald Trump	I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its tax payers.	0
114	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
115	Donald Trump	So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.	0
116	Donald Trump	We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our jobs.	0
117	Donald Trump	And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord and I think the people of sour country will be thrilled.	0
118	Donald Trump	And I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.	0
119	Donald Trump	But until we do that we're out of the agreement.	0
120	Donald Trump	I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issue.	0
121	Donald Trump	But under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.	0
122	Donald Trump	No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.	0
123	Donald Trump	The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wished to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement.	0
124	Donald Trump	It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States.	0
125	Donald Trump	That's not going to happen while I'm president, I'm sorry.	0
126	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
127	Donald Trump	My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on earth.	0
128	Donald Trump	And with the highest standard of living, and the highest standard of environmental protection.	0
129	Donald Trump	Our tax bill is moving along in Congress and I believe it's doing very well.	0
130	Donald Trump	I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.	0
131	Donald Trump	The Republicans are working very, very hard.	0
132	Donald Trump	We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone, but it's going very well.	0
133	Donald Trump	The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.	0
134	Donald Trump	They don't put America first.	0
135	Donald Trump	I do and I always will.	0
136	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
137	Donald Trump	The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance.	0
138	Donald Trump	You see what's happening.	0
139	Donald Trump	It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.	0
140	Donald Trump	At what point does America get demeaned?	0
141	Donald Trump	At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?	0
142	Donald Trump	We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.	0
143	Donald Trump	We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.	0
144	Donald Trump	They won't be.	0
145	Donald Trump	I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.	0
146	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
147	Donald Trump	I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests.	0
148	Donald Trump	Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.	0
149	Donald Trump	Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation.	0
150	Donald Trump	The process has begun from day one, but now we're down to business.	0
151	Donald Trump	Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called "green climate fund" -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments.	0
152	Donald Trump	So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're already way ahead of anybody else.	0
153	Donald Trump	Many of the other countries haven't spent anything.	0
154	Donald Trump	And many of them will never pay one dime.	0
155	Donald Trump	The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion.	0
156	Donald Trump	Nobody else is even close.	0
157	Donald Trump	Most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism.	0
158	Donald Trump	That's where they came.	0
159	Donald Trump	Believe me, they didn't come from me.	0
160	Donald Trump	They came just before I came into office.	0
161	Donald Trump	Not good.	0
162	Donald Trump	And not good the way they took the money.	0
163	Donald Trump	And not good the way they took the money.	0
164	Donald Trump	In 2015, the united nations' departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.	0
165	Donald Trump	In 2015, the green climate fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020, and nobody even knows where the money's going to.	0
166	Donald Trump	Nobody's been able to say, where is it going to?	0
167	Donald Trump	Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated.	0
168	Donald Trump	America is $20 trillion in debt-cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers.	0
169	Donald Trump	Or fix vital infrastructure.	0
170	Donald Trump	Millions of our citizens are out of work, and yet under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.	0
171	Donald Trump	So think of that.	0
172	Donald Trump	There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.	0
173	Donald Trump	Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world, should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. Economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives, thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty.	0
174	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
175	Donald Trump	Our constitution is unique among all nations of the world.	0
176	Donald Trump	And it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.	0
177	Donald Trump	And I will.	0
178	Donald Trump	Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves.	0
179	Donald Trump	Which we have started.	0
180	Donald Trump	Very strongly.	0
181	Donald Trump	It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.	0
182	Donald Trump	The risks grow as historically, these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.	0
183	Donald Trump	In other words, the Paris framework is just a starting point.	0
184	Donald Trump	As bad as it is.	0
185	Donald Trump	Not an end point.	0
186	Donald Trump	And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty.	0
187	Donald Trump	And massive future legal liability.	0
188	Donald Trump	Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.	0
189	Donald Trump	As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.	0
190	Donald Trump	The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.	0
191	Donald Trump	It is time to exit the Paris accord.	0
192	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
193	Donald Trump	And time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.	0
194	Donald Trump	It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France.	0
195	Donald Trump	It is time to make America great again.	0
196	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0

202	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
203	Donald Trump	Very important.	0
204	Donald Trump	I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.	0
205	Donald Trump	Scott, please?	0
206	Scott Pruitt	Thank you Mr. President.	0
207	Scott Pruitt	Your decision today to exit the Paris accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first.	0
208	Scott Pruitt	And by exiting you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.	0
209	Scott Pruitt	Please know that I'm thankful for your fortitude, your courage and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.	0
210	Scott Pruitt	America finally has a leader who answers only to the people, not the special interests who had their way for way too long.	0
211	Scott Pruitt	In everything that you do, Mr. President, you're fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.	0
212	Scott Pruitt	You're a cham... you're a champion for the hard working citizens, all across this land, who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interests.	0
213	Scott Pruitt	You have promised put America first in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to right-sizing Washington DC.	0
214	Scott Pruitt	And today, you put America first, with regard to international agreements and n the environment.	0
215	Scott Pruitt	This is an historic restoration of American economic independence, one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes.	0
216	Scott Pruitt	With this action, we have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.	0
217	Scott Pruitt	It should be noted that we as a nation to a better than anyone in the world, in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.	0
218	Scott Pruitt	We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.	0
219	Scott Pruitt	After all, before the Paris accord was ever signed, America reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.	0
220	Scott Pruitt	In factm between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18+ percent.	0
221	Scott Pruitt	And this was corrected accomplished, not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of American private sector.	0
222	Scott Pruitt	For that reason Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of the world does little.	0
223	Scott Pruitt	Other nations talk a good game.	0
224	Scott Pruitt	We lead with action.	0
225	Scott Pruitt	Not words.	0
226	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
227	Scott Pruitt	Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation, to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint, to learn from us.	0
228	Scott Pruitt	That should be our focus, versus agreed to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.	0
229	Scott Pruitt	Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment, to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what's right by American people.	0
230	Scott Pruitt	You have that courage.	0
231	Scott Pruitt	And the American people can take comfort, because you have their backs.	0
232	Scott Pruitt	Thank you Mr. President.	0
233	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
