1	COOPER	And welcome back.	0
2	COOPER	We’re coming to you tonight from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee with the “360” townhall.	0
3	COOPER	The three remaining Republican candidates campaigning hard with the primary here just a week away.	0
4	COOPER	We heard so far from Senator Ted Cruz.	0
5	COOPER	Right now the GOP front-runner, New York businessman Donald Trump.	0
6	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
7	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
8	COOPER	Hey, how are you doing?	0
9	COOPER	Nice to see you.	0
10	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
11	COOPER	Have a seat.	0
12	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
13	COOPER	So we got a lot of questions from the audience for you on a lot of policy issues.	0
14	COOPER	I got to start off with some news of the day topics.	0
15	COOPER	Your campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter by the arm.	0
16	COOPER	Will he continue as your campaign manager?	0
17	TRUMP	Yes, he will.	0
18	TRUMP	I looked at the tape.	0
19	TRUMP	I looked — it was my tape.	0
20	TRUMP	It was at one of my places.	0
21	TRUMP	I have great security and great security cameras.	0
22	TRUMP	I gave the tape, and frankly, if you look at that, people have looked at it — in fact, I just left another area of Wisconsin, we had a whole big meeting with a whole group of people, big audience, tremendous audience, and they’re all shaking their heads, give me a break, give me a break.	0
23	COOPER	Let me ask you, though…	0
24	TRUMP	The answer is yes.	0
25	TRUMP	And by the way, speaking of something else, I watched Ted Cruz.	0
26	TRUMP	His home state is not Florida.	0
27	TRUMP	His home state is Texas.	0
28	TRUMP	It may be Canada.	0
29	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
30	TRUMP	But to the best of my knowledge, it’s Texas.	0
31	TRUMP	So he made that — I was surprised you didn’t correct him actually.	0
32	COOPER	Let me ask you about Lewandowski.	0
33	COOPER	Initially your campaign said this never happened, there was no video of it.	0
34	COOPER	You came out and said you thought this person was, perhaps, making it up, this reporter.	0
35	COOPER	Lewandowski, himself, tweeted saying, I never met this reporter, I never touched this person; now the videotape shows he clearly did touch this person.	0
36	COOPER	Whether or not you think it was battery or not…	0
37	TRUMP	Touch — I don’t know what touch means.	0
38	TRUMP	I looked…	0
39	COOPER	Well, he says I never touched this person.	0
40	TRUMP	And then she says, oh, look, at my arm.	0
41	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
42	COOPER	Did he mislead you at all?	0
43	TRUMP	Not at all.	0
44	TRUMP	No, not at all.	0
45	TRUMP	Look, I didn’t know we had all these security cameras all over.	0
46	TRUMP	But the time I found out, I said, well, this is really wonderful, this exonerates him totally.	0
47	TRUMP	Now…	0
48	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
49	TRUMP	(inaudible) would have happened (inaudible) went to the ground or something to the effect that she almost went to the ground.	0
50	TRUMP	She was in pain.	0
51	TRUMP	She went to the ground.	0
52	TRUMP	When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.	1
53	TRUMP	She didn’t talk about it.	0
54	COOPER	No, that’s not true.	0
55	COOPER	She says her story has remained exactly the same.	0
56	COOPER	She was knocked a little bit off…	0
57	TRUMP	Oh really?	0
58	TRUMP	Can I read this to you this then?	0
59	COOPER	Yes, that she was knocked off balance but she remained standing.	0
60	TRUMP	Do you mind if I read this to you?	0
61	TRUMP	Do you mind if I read you her statement?	0
62	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
63	TRUMP	I mean, give me a break.	0
64	TRUMP	You know, the problem is everybody dumps people when there’s, like, a sign of political incorrectness.	0
65	TRUMP	I’m just going to read, if I can find it…	0
66	COOPER	She said she was almost knocked off balance, but she remained standing.	0
67	TRUMP	She said she was almost knocked off balance, right.	0
68	TRUMP	Here’s what she said.	0
69	TRUMP	You want to read it?	0
70	TRUMP	Or you want me to do it?	0
71	TRUMP	You’re a professional announcer.	0
72	TRUMP	Why don’t you read it.	0
73	TRUMP	The bottom part.	0
74	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
75	TRUMP	The bottom.	0
76	TRUMP	Now that’s an exact quote from her prior to seeing the cameras, and now she says, oh, I better change my story, I guess.	0
77	COOPER	This quote says, “I was jolted backwards.	0
78	COOPER	Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down.	0
79	COOPER	I almost knell fell to the ground but was able..”.	0
80	TRUMP	Yanked you down.	0
81	TRUMP	Did you see it?	0
82	TRUMP	Did she almost fall to the ground, Anderson?	0
83	COOPER	“… was able to maintain my balance nonetheless.	0
84	COOPER	I was shaken.	0
85	COOPER	Campaign managers aren’t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground.”	0
86	COOPER	No, she did not go down on the ground.	0
87	TRUMP	Oh no, let me just say — look, before she knows — folks, look, I’m a loyal person.	0
88	TRUMP	I’m going to be loyal to the country.	0
89	TRUMP	I’m going to be loyal to Wisconsin.	0
90	TRUMP	We have to tell it like it is.	0
91	TRUMP	It would be so easy for me to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family.	0
92	TRUMP	He’s got four beautiful children in New Hampshire, ruin his whole everything, and say you’re fired.	0
93	TRUMP	Okay?	0
94	TRUMP	I fired many people, especially on “The Apprentice.”	0
95	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
96	TRUMP	But look at what she says.	0
97	TRUMP	Michelle Fields, who, by the way, is not a baby.	0
98	TRUMP	OK?	0
99	TRUMP	In her own worlds, exactly.	0
100	TRUMP	“I was jolted backwards.” Well, she’s standing there.	0
101	TRUMP	“Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm.”  Tightly.	0
102	TRUMP	“And yanked me down.” She wasn’t yanked down.	0
103	TRUMP	She was – like, she didn’t even have any expression.	0
104	TRUMP	If somebody in this audience gets whacked, or gets hurt, including me, you get hit a little bit.	0
105	TRUMP	You go, ow.	0
106	TRUMP	There’s no emotion.	0
107	TRUMP	OK, wait a minute.	0
108	TRUMP	“I almost fell to the ground.” I almost fell to the ground; she didn’t almost fall to the ground.	0
109	TRUMP	He got in her way.	0
110	TRUMP	And by the way, she was grabbing me!	0
111	TRUMP	Am I supposed to press charges against her?	0
112	TRUMP	Oh, my arm is hurting.	0
113	TRUMP	Anderson, my arm is just killing me.	0
114	TRUMP	It’s never been the same.	0
115	COOPER	You’ve suggested you might —	0
116	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me!	0
117	TRUMP	I didn’t suggest.	0
118	COOPER	Oh, yeah, you did.	0
119	TRUMP	I tweeted.	0
120	TRUMP	No, no, I tweeted.	0
121	COOPER	A tweet is a suggestion.	0
122	TRUMP	Should I press charges?	0
123	COOPER	Are you going to?	0
124	TRUMP	Sure!	0
125	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
126	TRUMP	Maybe I should, right?	0
127	TRUMP	Because you know what?	0
128	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)	0
129	TRUMP	She was grabbing me.	0
130	TRUMP	And just so you understand, she was off base because she went through the Secret Service.	0
131	TRUMP	She had a pen in her hand which Secret Service is not liking because they don’t know what it is, whether it’s a little bomb or —	0
132	COOPER	So it doesn’t concern you that initially Corey Lewandowski said I never touched her, and that turns out not to be true?	0
133	TRUMP	I don’t think he knew her.	0
134	TRUMP	I mean, based on what I heard, I don’t think he really even knew who she was.	0
135	TRUMP	To the best of my knowledge, they really didn’t know each other.	0
136	TRUMP	Or he said he doesn’t know her.	0
137	TRUMP	But listen to this: “I almost fell to the ground,” which is untrue, “but was able to maintain my balance.” She had no trouble with her balance because it’s right on tape.	0
138	TRUMP	“Nonetheless, I was shaken.	0
139	TRUMP	Campaign managers aren’t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground.” She didn’t go to the ground!	0
140	TRUMP	She didn’t even have an expression on her face.	0
141	COOPER	Do you think this is politically motivated?	0
142	TRUMP	It could be.	0
143	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
144	TRUMP	Look, I’ll tell you what: a friend of mine who’s in law enforcement said to me, there’s probably not a detective in the world that would have done what they did to him.	0
145	TRUMP	I mean, people in Syria —	0
146	COOPER	The state attorney’s a Democrat.	0
147	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me.	0
148	TRUMP	Oh, really?	0
149	TRUMP	Oh, I’m shocked to hear that.	0
150	TRUMP	You know,	0
151	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
152	TRUMP	You know, people, are chopping off heads in the Middle East.	0
153	TRUMP	They’re drowning people in cages by 50s.	0
154	TRUMP	They’re drowning — here’s a guy – she shouldn’t have been touching me.	0
155	TRUMP	Okay?	0
156	TRUMP	And you saw that she did that.	0
157	TRUMP	She was grabbing me.	0
158	TRUMP	Twice.	0
159	TRUMP	I looked at her.	0
160	TRUMP	In fact, one of the great pictures is me going like this like, get away from me, who is this person?	0
161	TRUMP	Okay?	0
162	TRUMP	But my arm, it’s never been the same, folks.	0
163	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
164	TRUMP	Never been the same.	0
165	TRUMP	So let me just tell you, she went through Secret Service, boom.	0
166	TRUMP	She grabbed me, and he really stepped in front of her.	0
167	TRUMP	I didn’t see the grab; he stepped in front of her.	0
168	TRUMP	She wasn’t supposed to be asking questions because the press conference lasted for 45 minutes, and all questions were done.	0
169	TRUMP	And I was walking rapidly outside.	0
170	COOPER	But this is the second time Lewandowski has touched somebody.	0
171	COOPER	He did this to a protester, he grabbed a guy by the collar.	0
172	COOPER	Something which you actually backed him up on And you said –	0
173	TRUMP	I back people up.	0
174	TRUMP	And I back up (INAUDIBLE).	0
175	TRUMP	Did you see what he did?	0
176	TRUMP	Did you see what he did?	0
177	COOPER	I did.	0
178	COOPER	In fact, there’s the video right there.	0
179	TRUMP	Did you see the sign the protester was holding?	0
180	COOPER	No I didn’t.	0
181	TRUMP	Did you see what was on that sign?	0
182	COOPER	No, I didn’t.	0
183	TRUMP	Do me a favor.	0
184	TRUMP	Take a look at what was on the sign.	0
185	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
186	COOPER	But should your campaign manager be laying hands on anybody?	0
187	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
188	TRUMP	Did you see the protester grabbing the woman in front of him?	0
189	TRUMP	With his hands on her neck?	0
190	COOPER	No.	0
191	TRUMP	OK. Take a look.	0
192	TRUMP	You know what he did?	0
193	TRUMP	He had his shirt with two fingers like this, and then he let go because security was behind him, and they took off.	0
194	COOPER	Your opponents are suggesting, on the Republican side, are suggesting that this says something about your leadership, that you’re condoning this kind of thing –	0
195	TRUMP	Oh, I think my leadership is very good.	0
196	TRUMP	I’ve watched Ted Cruz, I watched him.	0
197	TRUMP	He didn’t even know what state he comes from, OK?	0
198	TRUMP	I watched him talking about he comes from the state of Florida.	0
199	TRUMP	Fort Hood is in Texas, by the way.	0
200	TRUMP	But if you see what he said.	0
201	TRUMP	I don’t know.	0
202	TRUMP	I’m so surprised with him, Anderson, that you let him get away with that.	0
203	TRUMP	But I’ll tell you what.	0
204	TRUMP	You just take a look – you just take a look at what’s going on.	0
205	TRUMP	I stick up for people when they’re right.	0
206	TRUMP	I would have loved to have fired – it would have been much easier than talking to you about this all night long.	0
207	TRUMP	I’d rather talk about the issues, to be honest.	0
208	TRUMP	But I stick up –	0
209	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
210	TRUMP	Right?	0
211	TRUMP	I stick up for people when people are unjustly accused.	0
212	TRUMP	And in my opinion, unjustly accused.	0
213	TRUMP	She’s grabbing me.	0
214	TRUMP	He walks in to stop it.	0
215	TRUMP	She walked through Secret Service.	0
216	TRUMP	She had a pen in her hand, which could have been a knife, it could have been just a pen, which is very dangerous.	0
217	TRUMP	She should not have been doing that.	0
218	TRUMP	And she didn’t fall to the ground.	0
219	TRUMP	She wasn’t dragged to the ground and all of the things that she said, Anderson.	0
220	TRUMP	I stick up for people, and I don’t want to ruin somebody’s life.	0
221	TRUMP	It would have been very easy for me to do so.	0
222	TRUMP	You know, when I owned Miss Universe, I had the case of the young woman who was very unjustly accused by somebody that you know very well.	0
223	TRUMP	And I gave her a second chance.	0
224	TRUMP	And I’m very proud of her.	0
225	TRUMP	She had a tremendous substance abuse problem and I’m very – Tara, I’m very, very proud of her.	0
226	TRUMP	I’m very proud of the job she did.	0
227	COOPER	I want to ask you about another tweet you sent.	0
228	COOPER	You sent a tweet over the weekend about the death toll in this horrible terror attack in Pakistan over the weekend.	0
229	TRUMP	Right.	0
230	COOPER	You talked about the death toll.	0
231	COOPER	And then you said, I alone can solve.	0
232	COOPER	What do you mean by that?	0
233	TRUMP	I think I alone because I know my competition.	0
234	TRUMP	Look, I know my competition.	0
235	COOPER	You, alone, among the Republican candidates.	0
236	TRUMP	I see Hillary with Benghazi, you know the famous ad, 3:00 in the morning, guess what, the phone rang, she wasn’t there.	0
237	TRUMP	Unless Sidney called, if Sidney called she was there.	0
238	COOPER	But you’re the only one who can solve terror problems in Pakistan?	0
239	COOPER	I mean, Pakistan…	0
240	TRUMP	Yes, of the ones that are running, I’m the only one.	0
241	TRUMP	I know what I’m running.	0
242	TRUMP	I know the competition.	0
243	TRUMP	And believe me, I know, I watched Ted Cruz.	0
244	COOPER	How though?	0
245	COOPER	I mean, what…	0
246	TRUMP	So phony.	0
247	TRUMP	I mean, you know, I know you have couple people out there because he put them in the audience.	0
248	TRUMP	But it’s so false.	0
249	TRUMP	You know, the whole thing with the five-second intermissions between sentences.	0
250	TRUMP	No.	0
251	TRUMP	Yes, I think I am the one to be able to solve the problem.	0
252	COOPER	But, I mean, there’s problems in a lot of different countries, problems in the United States.	0
253	COOPER	How can you solve the problems all the way over in Pakistan when the Pakistanis, themselves, are struggling with it?	0
254	TRUMP	Look, look, Pakistan is a very, very vital problem and really vital country for us because they have a thing called nuclear weapons.	0
255	TRUMP	They have to get a hold of their situation.	0
256	TRUMP	When I see that and when I see it put in a park because it was mostly Christians, although many others were killed other than Christians, I think it’s just absolutely a horrible story.	0
257	TRUMP	But I’m talking about radical Islamic terrorism.	0
258	TRUMP	I will solve it far better than anybody else running.	0
259	COOPER	Let’s talk about nuclear issues because you talked about this in a really interesting article in The New York Times.	0
260	TRUMP	One of the very, very big issues.	0
261	TRUMP	I think maybe the biggest issue of our time.	0
262	COOPER	That’s what you said to The New York Times.	0
263	COOPER	You said you worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons…	0
264	TRUMP	Right.	0
265	COOPER	… the most.	0
266	COOPER	You also said, though, that you might support Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons of their own.	0
267	COOPER	Isn’t that completely contradictory?	0
268	TRUMP	No, not at all.	0
269	TRUMP	Look, you have North Korea has nuclear weapons.	0
270	TRUMP	And he doesn’t have a carrier yet but he has got nuclear weapons.	0
271	TRUMP	He soon will have.	0
272	TRUMP	We don’t want to pull the trigger.	0
273	TRUMP	We’re just — you know, we have a president, frankly, that doesn’t — nobody is afraid of our president.	0
274	TRUMP	Nobody respects our president.	0
275	TRUMP	You take a look at what’s going on throughout the world.	0
276	TRUMP	It’s not the country that it was.	0
277	COOPER	But if you’re concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn’t that proliferation?	0
278	TRUMP	No, no.	0
279	TRUMP	We owe $19 $trillion, we have another $2 trillion because of the very, very bad omnibus budget that was just signed.	0
280	TRUMP	It’s a disgrace, which gives everything that Obama wanted.	0
281	TRUMP	We get nothing.	0
282	TRUMP	They get everything.	0
283	TRUMP	So that’s going to be $21 trillion.	0
284	TRUMP	We are supporting nations now, militarily, we are supporting nations like Saudi Arabia which was making during the good oil days which was a year ago, now they’re making less but still a lot, $1 billion a day.	0
285	TRUMP	We are supporting them, militarily, and pay us a fraction, a fraction of what they should be paying us and of the cost.	0
286	TRUMP	We are supporting Japan.	0
287	TRUMP	Most people didn’t even know that.	0
288	TRUMP	Most people didn’t know that we are taking care of Japan’s military needs.	0
289	TRUMP	We’re supporting…	0
290	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
291	TRUMP	Excuse me, excuse me, we’re supporting Germany.	0
292	TRUMP	We’re supporting South Korea.	0
293	TRUMP	I order thousands of television sets because I am in the real estate business, you know, in my other life, OK.	0
294	COOPER	It has been a U.S. policy for decades to prevent Japan from getting a nuclear weapon.	0
295	TRUMP	That might be policy, but maybe…	0
296	COOPER	South Korea as well.	0
297	TRUMP	Can I be honest are you?	0
298	TRUMP	Maybe it’s going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it.	0
299	TRUMP	You have so many other countries are now having it…	0
300	COOPER	So some proliferation is OK?	0
301	TRUMP	No, no, not proliferation.	0
302	TRUMP	I hate nuclear more than any.	0
303	TRUMP	My uncle was a professor was at MIT, used to (AUDIO GAP) nuclear, he used to tell me about the problem.	0
304	COOPER	But that’s contradictory about Japan and South Korea.	0
305	TRUMP	(AUDIO GAP) Iran is going to have it very — within…	0
306	COOPER	But that’s proliferation.	0
307	TRUMP	Excuse me, one of the dumbest I’ve ever seen signed ever, ever, ever by anybody, Iran is going to have it within 10 years.	0
308	TRUMP	Iran is going to have it.	0
309	TRUMP	I thought it was a very good interview in The New York Times.	0
310	COOPER	So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having…	0
311	TRUMP	I thought…	0
312	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
313	COOPER	… nuclear weapons.	0
314	TRUMP	At some point we have to say, you know what, we’re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we’re better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have…	0
315	COOPER	Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?	0
316	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, absolutely.	0
317	COOPER	You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?	0
318	TRUMP	No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.	0
319	TRUMP	Here’s the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.	0
320	COOPER	So if you said, Japan, yes, it’s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?	0
321	TRUMP	Can I be honest with you?	0
322	TRUMP	It’s going to happen, anyway.	0
323	TRUMP	It’s going to happen anyway.	0
324	TRUMP	It’s only a question of time.	0
325	TRUMP	They’re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely.	0
326	TRUMP	But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.	0
327	TRUMP	Now, wouldn’t you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?	0
328	TRUMP	And they do have them.	0
329	TRUMP	They absolutely have them.	0
330	TRUMP	They can’t — they have no carrier system yet but they will very soon.	0
331	TRUMP	Wouldn’t you rather have Japan, perhaps, they’re over there, they’re very close, they’re very fearful of North Korea, and we’re supposed to protect.	0
332	COOPER	So you’re saying you don’t want more nuclear weapons in the world but you’re OK with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?	0
333	TRUMP	I don’t want more nuclear weapons.	0
334	TRUMP	I think that — you know, when I hear Obama get up and say the biggest threat to the world today is global warming, I say, is this guy kidding?	1
335	TRUMP	The only global warming — the only global warming I’m worried about is nuclear global warming because that’s the single biggest threat.	0
336	TRUMP	So it’s not that I’m a fan — we can’t afford it anymore.	0
337	TRUMP	We’re sitting on a tremendous bubble.	0
338	TRUMP	We’re going to be — again, $21 trillion.	0
339	TRUMP	We don’t have money.	0
340	COOPER	So you have no security concerns…	0
341	TRUMP	We’re using all of the money…	0
342	COOPER	… about Japan or South Korea getting nuclear weapons?	0
343	TRUMP	Anderson, when you see all of the money that our country is spending on military, we’re not spending it for ourselves; we’re protecting all of these nations all over the world.	0
344	TRUMP	We can’t afford to do it anymore.	0
345	COOPER	But isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Europe.	0
346	COOPER	Isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Asia.	0
347	TRUMP	There’s a benefit, but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States, because that’s what’s happening.	0
348	TRUMP	We can’t afford it.	0
349	TRUMP	It’s very simple.	0
350	TRUMP	Now, I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.	0
351	TRUMP	Because we’re not pulling the trigger.	0
352	TRUMP	The bottom line on North Korea is china, if they wanted to, they’re a tremendous supplier of North Korea.	0
353	TRUMP	They have tremendous power over North Korea.	0
354	TRUMP	If they wanted to, if they weren’t toying with us, Anderson, China would be the one that would get in and could make a deal in one day, okay…	0
355	COOPER	I want to bring into the audience just a moment.	0
356	COOPER	Just a last question before we do.	0
357	COOPER	I’ve got to ask you about this back and forth between you and Senator Cruz about wives.	0
358	COOPER	After saying that you were going to spill the beans about Heidi Cruz, you retweeted an unflattering picture of her next to a picture of your wife.	0
359	TRUMP	I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi.	0
360	TRUMP	I thought it was fine.	0
361	COOPER	Come on.	0
362	TRUMP	I thought it was fine.	0
363	TRUMP	She’s a pretty woman.	0
364	COOPER	You’re running for president of the United States.	0
365	TRUMP	Excuse me, I didn’t start it.	0
366	TRUMP	I didn’t start it.	0
367	COOPER	But, sir, with all due respect, that’s the argument of 5-year-old.	0
368	TRUMP	No, it’s not.	0
369	COOPER	The argument of a 5-year-old is he started it.	0
370	TRUMP	You would say that.	0
371	TRUMP	That’s the problem with our country.	0
372	COOPER	Every parent knows a kid who says he started it.	0
373	TRUMP	That’s not a 5-year-old.	0
374	TRUMP	Excuse.	0
375	TRUMP	No, no, no.	0
376	TRUMP	That’s the problem.	0
377	TRUMP	Exactly that thinking is the problem this country has.	0
378	TRUMP	I did not start this.	0
379	TRUMP	He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture…	0
380	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
381	COOPER	He didn’t send out a picture.	0
382	COOPER	It was an anti-Trump super PAC sent out.	0
383	TRUMP	Anderson, it was a cover story of a picture taken by Antoine Verglas, one of the great photographers of the world, by the way.	0
384	TRUMP	My wife was a very, very successful model, like one of the most.	0
385	COOPER	A very successful model of course.	0
386	TRUMP	It was a picture for the cover of “GQ,” which is a decent — which is a very good magazine.	0
387	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
388	COOPER	It wasn’t even a pro-Cruz super PAC; it was an anti-Trump super PAC.	0
389	TRUMP	Excuse me, they were Romney people.	0
390	TRUMP	Romney is, you know, very embarrassed that he did so badly four years ago.	0
391	TRUMP	The guy choked like a dog and lost an election…	0
392	COOPER	Do you have proof that he sent it out?	0
393	TRUMP	No, everybody knows he sent it out.	0
394	TRUMP	He knew the people in the super PAC.	0
395	TRUMP	He knew — I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase.	0
396	TRUMP	You know, this is — would you like to have this as your first lady?	0
397	TRUMP	And a lot of people said, yes, actually, if you want to know the truth.	0
398	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
399	TRUMP	But she was a magnificent model.	0
400	TRUMP	She took a picture with one of the great photographers of the world.	0
401	TRUMP	They put it on “GQ.”  All of a sudden we see this picture going all over Utah just before the election.	0
402	TRUMP	And by the way, when he said, “We had a big day, we won Utah.”  Excuse me, I won Arizona with far more delegates, and as you probably saw, 25 minutes ago, so maybe you didn’t see it, the vote was just counted in Missouri and I won Missouri, too.	0
403	COOPER	Congratulations.	0
404	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
405	TRUMP	Picked up another 12 or 13 delegates.	0
406	COOPER	Your wife is lovely, she’s very intelligent.	0
407	COOPER	Heidi Cruz, I haven’t interviewed her — she seems like a very intelligent, very accomplished person as well.	0
408	COOPER	Can you just leave wives out of this?	0
409	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
410	TRUMP	I’d like to do it.	0
411	COOPER	But why retweet — why retweet somebody?	0
412	TRUMP	I would love to do it.	0
413	TRUMP	I really would rather talk about nuclear proliferation.	0
414	TRUMP	It’s a slightly more important subject.	0
415	COOPER	You act as if retweeting is not an endorsement.	0
416	TRUMP	Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it.	0
417	TRUMP	I didn’t send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah.	0
418	TRUMP	He did.	0
419	TRUMP	He knew about it.	0
420	TRUMP	It was his people, who were his friends.	0
421	TRUMP	It was a PAC that’s…	0
422	COOPER	Couldn’t you just let it go, though?	0
423	COOPER	Do you have to retweet some random person sending you…	0
424	TRUMP	No, I don’t let things go so easy.	0
425	TRUMP	And let me tell you something.	0
426	TRUMP	I don’t let the — if I were running the country, I wouldn’t have people taking advantage of the United States in trade and in every other way, either.	0
427	TRUMP	Believe me, I wouldn’t have China walking away with trade deficits of $505 billion a year.	0
428	TRUMP	I wouldn’t have Mexico laughing at us how stupid we are with trade deals, and at the border.	0
429	TRUMP	I wouldn’t let Japan get away what they’re doing with, you know, devaluation of the yen.	0
430	TRUMP	China big league devaluation.	0
431	TRUMP	No, I — when somebody…	0
432	COOPER	Can you say tonight, though, no more such about wives?	0
433	TRUMP	Oh, absolutely.	0
434	TRUMP	I don’t want to talk about that.	0
435	TRUMP	It’s ridiculous to be talking about that.	0
436	COOPER	All right, let’s go to the audience.	0
437	COOPER	I want you to meet retired Lieutenant Brian Murphy.	0
438	COOPER	He as first the officer to report to the Sikh temple massacre in Oak Creek, and was shot 15 times.	0
439	COOPER	His fellow officer, who is standing next to him, Sam Lenda…	0
440	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
441	COOPER	Sam Lenda took out…	0
442	TRUMP	Great.	0
443	COOPER	His fellow officer standing next to him, Sam Lenda, took out the shooter that day, is also with us.	0
444	COOPER	We wanted to just first of all take a moment to thank both of them for their service and their actions.	0
445	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
446	COOPER	Brian has a question for you tonight.	0
447	COOPER	He says he’s — he likes Governor Kasich but he’s still undecided — so Brian.	0
448	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
449	QUESTION	I have a question.	0
450	QUESTION	In light of the Brussels and Paris attacks one of the quickest knee-jerk reactions is a backlash against specific minority religious groups.	0
451	QUESTION	This, in turn, brings about things that cause damage all over.	0
452	QUESTION	In Milwaukee, you heard about the Sikh temple shooting.	0
453	QUESTION	Six people were killed.	0
454	QUESTION	99 percent of the men in the United States who wear turbans are actually Sikh and not Muslim.	0
455	QUESTION	How would you suggest we help educate the public and not alienate these groups and, at the same time, how do we protect the constitutional rights of minority groups like the Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, and Jews, while still addressing radical Islamization?	0
456	TRUMP	Well, Brian, thank you for the question.	0
457	TRUMP	We have a tremendous problem with radical Islam whether we like it or we don’t.	0
458	TRUMP	We have a president who won’t talk about it.	0
459	TRUMP	I mean, Ted was saying the same thing.	0
460	TRUMP	We have a president who won’t talk about it.	0
461	TRUMP	Why he won’t talk about, perhaps only he knows, but it’s a disgrace what’s going on.	0
462	TRUMP	We have a serious, serious problem, and when I called for a temporary ban I thought that was a very bad thing for me to do politically, but I felt I should do it.	0
463	TRUMP	And, I didn’t know that I would go up in the polls opposed to down.	0
464	TRUMP	I did that because I really felt there had to be something done.	0
465	TRUMP	That was after the horrible San Bernardino, California situation.	0
466	TRUMP	After, obviously, Paris which was terrible.	0
467	TRUMP	You know, we talk about Paris with the gun-free zones, we talk about Paris with their strong gun laws, by the way.	0
468	TRUMP	Nobody had guns except for the bad guys.	0
469	TRUMP	If we would have had guns on the other side going, in terms of Second Amendment having to do, if bullets were — same thing with San Bernardino.	0
470	TRUMP	If bullets were going in the opposite direction, you wouldn’t have had the problems in those two places, that I can tell you.	0
471	TRUMP	So, I think we have to be extremely careful with our Second Amendment, and we have to cherish our Second Amendment.	0
472	TRUMP	Very important.	0
473	TRUMP	But, I would say this, when I called for the temporary banning, we have to look at it.	0
474	TRUMP	We have a serious problem, I think you’ll admit that, Brian.	0
475	TRUMP	We have a very, very serious problem with radical Islam, and if we don’t want to discuss it, and if we don’t want to look at it, we’re never going to solve the problem.	0
476	TRUMP	We have to be extremely strong with ISIS.	0
477	TRUMP	We have to wipe ISIS off the face of the Earth so fast and so violently we have no choice.	0
478	TRUMP	We have no choice.	0
479	TRUMP	And, I was against the war in Iraq.	0
480	TRUMP	OK?	0
481	TRUMP	I am not a fast trigger.	0
482	TRUMP	I’m exactly the opposite of that.	0
483	TRUMP	We should have never gone in, it destabilized the Middle East.	0
484	TRUMP	But, I will tell you this, we got out.	0
485	TRUMP	Obama got us out very badly.	0
486	TRUMP	Instead of leaving some troops, instead of giving a date, instead of, you know, with the exact time, I would say this though — we have no choice but to look at that.	0
487	TRUMP	We have to be very, very vigilant.	0
488	TRUMP	Very smart, and frankly, Brian, we have to be very tough because it’s only going to get worse.	0
489	TRUMP	Thousands of people are being allowed into this country over short periods of time coming supposedly from Syria.	0
490	TRUMP	We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where is their paperwork.	0
491	TRUMP	They have no paperwork; they have no identification.	0
492	TRUMP	They’re coming into  this country and it’s going to be a big, big problem.	0
493	COOPER	The other, though, part of Lieutenant Murphy’s question was about protecting the rights of minority groups, of Muslims, or Sikhs, of Jews, and others inside the United States…	0
494	TRUMP	…  I want to do that also, and I do want to do that, but I at the same time we have to recognize we have a serious problem.	0
495	COOPER	Let me follow up on that.	0
496	COOPER	You said you agreed, I think you said you agreed, with Senator Ted Cruz’s proposal in the wake of the Brussels attack that law enforcement should, quote, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” I talked to him about this in the last hour.	0
497	COOPER	Bill Bratton, Commissioner, the Chief of Police…	0
498	TRUMP	…  Who I like very much…	0
499	COOPER	…  In your home city.	0
500	COOPER	Chief of Police under Giuliani, as well as now de Blasio, again — out in L.A.	0
501	COOPER	He said about Ted Cruz’s proposal, “we do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion.” Is he wrong?	0
502	TRUMP	I think we have to be extremely vigilant in those areas, we have to look very seriously at the Mosques.	0
503	TRUMP	Lots of things happening in the Mosques, that’s been proven.	0
504	TRUMP	You look at what’s going on in Paris where Mosques are being closed, OK?	0
505	TRUMP	And, we have to look very, very seriously.	0
506	COOPER	There’s a lot of Muslims in America who hear that, saying we got to look seriously at the Mosques…	0
507	TRUMP	…  Let me just tell you something, in San Bernadino people know what was going on.	0
508	TRUMP	These two people — probably became radicalized through her.	0
509	TRUMP	Who knows?	0
510	TRUMP	Frankly, right now, it doesn’t matter.	0
511	TRUMP	But, these two people want to kill their co-workers, et cetera, et cetera, in their apartment, or their house.	0
512	TRUMP	In their place where they lived, they had bombs all over the apartment…	0
513	COOPER	…  Do you trust…	0
514	TRUMP	…  Excuse me — they had bombs on the floor.	0
515	TRUMP	Many people saw this.	0
516	TRUMP	Many, many people.	0
517	TRUMP	Muslims living with them in the same area.	0
518	TRUMP	They saw that house, they saw that.	0
519	TRUMP	One didn’t want to turn them in.	0
520	TRUMP	He said I don’t know turn them in because I don’t want to be accused of racial profiling.	0
521	TRUMP	He saw bombs all over the apartment, OK?	0
522	TRUMP	It’s just an excuse…	0
523	COOPER	…  Do you trust Muslims in America?	0
524	TRUMP	…  Do I what?	0
525	COOPER	Trust Muslims in America?	0
526	TRUMP	Many of them I do.	0
527	TRUMP	Many of them I do, and some, I guess, we don’t.	0
528	TRUMP	Some, I guess, we don’t.	0
529	TRUMP	We have a problem, and we can try and be very politically correct and pretend we don’t have a problem, but, Anderson, we have a major, major problem.	0
530	TRUMP	This is, in a sense, this is a war…	0
531	COOPER	…  So, special patrols in Muslim neighborhoods…	0
532	TRUMP	… You know, nobody wants to call it a war — excuse me.	0
533	TRUMP	Nobody wants to call it a war.	0
534	TRUMP	It’s a war.	0
535	TRUMP	There’s a war.	0
536	TRUMP	The difference is it’s not like you’re fighting Germany or Japan where they have a uniform, we have a uniform, everybody has a different uniform.	0
537	TRUMP	We don’t know where these people are.	0
538	COOPER	I want you to meet Jeff Johns.	0
539	COOPER	He’s a financial consultant.	0
540	COOPER	He said he is on the Trump train as of this point.	0
541	TRUMP	I like him.	0
542	TRUMP	I like him very much.	0
543	COOPER	I knew you would.	0
544	TRUMP	I like him.	0
545	QUESTION	Thank you for coming to the great city of Milwaukee.	0
546	TRUMP	Thank you, Jeff.	0
547	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, you have a high net worth in the billions of dollars but many people don’t think that you’re a successful businessman.	0
548	QUESTION	They refer to your inherited wealth and how it’s just a track that pays the average market index.	0
549	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, what do you say to those people that do not think that you’re a successful businessman?	0
550	TRUMP	Yes, I love the question because it’s such lies.	0
551	TRUMP	I started off in Brooklyn.	0
552	TRUMP	My father was a builder in Brooklyn.	0
553	TRUMP	Brooklyn had not a lot of value.	0
554	TRUMP	Brooklyn was not a great place to be.	0
555	TRUMP	I wanted to always go into Manhattan.	0
556	TRUMP	My father, my first deal and my first loan was $1 million from my father which was a loan, I had to pay him back.	0
557	TRUMP	I did numerous deals in Manhattan.	0
558	TRUMP	My father said, don’t go into Manhattan, it’s not our territory, we can’t do that, it’s not for us.	0
559	TRUMP	I started off with a very, very small amount of money.	0
560	TRUMP	And by the way, when my father passed away, remember, I have four — I have a total of five in my family.	0
561	TRUMP	So we have brothers, sisters, split.	0
562	TRUMP	And when my father died, by that time I had already built a great fortune and my father didn’t leave a great fortune.	0
563	TRUMP	It was Brooklyn and Queens real estate and it wasn’t a great fortune.	0
564	TRUMP	But now what they do is they build it up like, oh, he left Donald money.	0
565	TRUMP	I started off — and you understand, you know the true answer because you’re somebody that understands me and you understand where it started.	0
566	TRUMP	I started off with $1 million and now I’m worth over $10 billion.	0
567	TRUMP	And I filed my papers with the election committees, with the federal election, and people in your world, in your profession, are down there, or have been down there all the time and they can’t believe how great those papers are.	0
568	TRUMP	Very little debt.	0
569	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets in the world.	0
570	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets in the world.	0
571	TRUMP	And, very importantly, tremendous cash flow.	0
572	TRUMP	And I don’t say that in a bragging way.	0
573	TRUMP	I say that because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
574	TRUMP	And I want to say this, before my father died, he said, everything Donald touches turns to gold.	0
575	TRUMP	It’s absolutely — he was so proud of me.	0
576	TRUMP	But I borrowed very little money from my father.	0
577	TRUMP	What I did borrow and the thing that really helped me with my father was his knowledge.	0
578	TRUMP	He was an excellent negotiator.	0
579	TRUMP	He was an excellent builder.	0
580	TRUMP	But he built in Brooklyn and Queens, there wasn’t that much money in Brooklyn and Queens.	0
581	COOPER	A lot of other candidates have released tax returns.	0
582	COOPER	You say you won’t release them because you’re being audited.	0
583	COOPER	There are some people who doubt you’re even being audited or have been audited as much as…	0
584	TRUMP	Oh, I can give you a letter for that.	0
585	TRUMP	Would you like a letter?	0
586	TRUMP	I’ll give you…	0
587	COOPER	Can you?	0
588	TRUMP	I’ll give it to you, sure, absolutely.	0
589	COOPER	Because some people have raised that as a doubt.	0
590	TRUMP	And only a fool would give a tax return…	0
591	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
592	COOPER	So you can offer evidence that you are being audited or have been audited like you say?	0
593	TRUMP	A hundred percent.	0
594	TRUMP	I’ll give you a letter from the biggest firm in Washington that does my work for me.	0
595	COOPER	All right.	0
596	TRUMP	OK?	0
597	COOPER	I want you to meet Robert Kitelinger.	0
598	COOPER	He’s retired from the U.S. Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
599	COOPER	He’s now a student at Marquette University…	0
600	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
601	COOPER	Robert?	0
602	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
603	QUESTION	In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?	0
604	TRUMP	Say it again?	0
605	QUESTION	In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?	0
606	TRUMP	Well, the greatest function of all by far is security for our nation.	0
607	TRUMP	I would also say health care, I would also say education.	0
608	TRUMP	I mean, there are many, many things, but I would say the top three are security, security, security.	0
609	TRUMP	We have to have security for our country so that we can continue to exist as a country.	0
610	TRUMP	We are in danger.	0
611	TRUMP	Thousands and thousands of people are infiltrating our country.	0
612	TRUMP	We don’t know who they are.	0
613	TRUMP	There’s a very vicious world.	0
614	TRUMP	We’re living in a very vicious world and we’re doing something that is against a lot of very smart people’s wishes.	0
615	TRUMP	I can tell you, it’s totally against my wishes.	0
616	COOPER	So top three, you’re saying, security.	0
617	TRUMP	Security.	0
618	TRUMP	I say all top three are security, but health care, education, would be probably three that would be top.	0
619	TRUMP	And then you can go on from there.	0
620	TRUMP	But the military and the secure country, so that we have a country.	0
621	TRUMP	Believe me, we’ve never been in a position, in my opinion, where our country is so vulnerable.	0
622	TRUMP	Our military is being eaten away.	0
623	TRUMP	When General Odierno left recently, a year ago, I was watching him on maybe your show, one of the shows, and he said that the United States Army, the United States military forces have never been so — and I think he used the word depleted.	0
624	TRUMP	But basically he said they’re exhausted.	0
625	COOPER	So just to follow-up, though…	0
626	TRUMP	And that’s a pretty — that’s a pretty sad commentary.	0
627	TRUMP	And honestly, even though he was retiring at the time — and I had a lot of respect for him, good man, but even though he was leaving at the time, people shouldn’t say that because you’re giving the enemy ideas.	0
628	TRUMP	But if I get in, our military will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before.	0
629	TRUMP	It’s the cheapest thing we can do.	0
630	COOPER	So in terms of federal government role, you’re saying security, but you also say health care and education should be provided by the federal government?	0
631	TRUMP	Well, those are two of the things.	0
632	TRUMP	Yes, sure.	0
633	TRUMP	I mean, there are obviously many things, housing, providing great neighborhoods…	0
634	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
635	COOPER	Aren’t you against the federal government’s involvement in education?	0
636	COOPER	don’t you want it to devolve to states?	0
637	TRUMP	I want it to go to state, yes.	0
638	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
639	TRUMP	I want — right now…	0
640	COOPER	So that’s not part of what the federal government’s…	0
641	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
642	TRUMP	The federal government, but the concept of the country is the concept that we have to have education within the country, and we have to get rid of common core and it should be brought to the state level.	0
643	COOPER	And federal health care run by the federal government?	0
644	TRUMP	Health care — we need health care for our people.	0
645	TRUMP	We need a good — Obamacare is a disaster.	0
646	TRUMP	It’s proven to be…	0
647	COOPER	But is that something the federal government should be doing?	0
648	TRUMP	The government can lead it, but it should be privately done.	0
649	TRUMP	It should be privately done.	0
650	TRUMP	So that health care — in my opinion, we should probably have — we have to have private health care.	0
651	TRUMP	We don’t have competition in health care.	0
652	TRUMP	The problem that we have in our country is we don’t have competition.	0
653	TRUMP	It’s made because the politicians — by the way, I’m self-funding.	1
654	TRUMP	I am self-funding.	0
655	TRUMP	So the health care companies aren’t taking care of me.	0
656	TRUMP	But they’re taking care of everyone else.	0
657	TRUMP	Wait one second.	0
658	TRUMP	We don’t have — we don’t have bidding.	0
659	TRUMP	We don’t have competition in health care.	0
660	TRUMP	And it’s a disaster.	0
661	TRUMP	Obamacare, if you take a look at your premiums, they’re going up 35 percent, 45 percent, 55 percent, and the deductibles are so high, you’ll never get to use it.	0
662	COOPER	You always say you’re self-funding.	0
663	COOPER	How much do you think your campaign has cost — in the past you said $25 million.	0
664	TRUMP	I can tell you, I’d say I’m in right now for — now, I’m in for about $35 million right now.	0
665	COOPER	Okay.	0
666	TRUMP	We take the small loans, the people that send $17.50, or $250, even $1,000…	0
667	COOPER	And you solicit those on your website.	0
668	TRUMP	No, I sell hats and shirts and…	0
669	COOPER	No, but you do solicit donations on your website?	0
670	TRUMP	No, I don’t really think so.	0
671	COOPER	Yes, you do.	0
672	COOPER	You have two spots (ph), where you do.	0
673	TRUMP	Okay, whatever.	0
674	TRUMP	Whatever.	0
675	TRUMP	It’s peanuts.	0
676	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
677	COOPER	It’s not peanuts; it’s $7 million — it’s a lot of money.	0
678	TRUMP	I’ll tell you what, what I’ve done is I’m in for about $35 million.	0
679	COOPER	It’s about a third of your campaign is funded by other people.	0
680	TRUMP	No it’s not.	0
681	TRUMP	No, it’s not, not a third.	0
682	TRUMP	Whatever the hats are, they also cost something.	0
683	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
684	COOPER	Well, according to the FTC you’ve raised more than, I think, $7 million last time I checked from individual donations.	0
685	TRUMP	Let me put it differently.	0
686	TRUMP	I am not soliciting money from insurance companies and from lumber companies and from banks and from — if I did, I would have made Jeb Bush look like a baby.	0
687	TRUMP	I have turned down more $10 million offers.	0
688	TRUMP	Just the other night, I’m in Florida, and a very, very rich friend of mine comes up, Donald, I’d like to give you $10 million, I’ll give you anything…	0
689	COOPER	You’ve actually been loaning your campaign a lot of money.	0
690	COOPER	Are you going to have your campaign pay you back?	0
691	TRUMP	I doubt it.	0
692	TRUMP	But it just seems to be the way it’s done.	0
693	COOPER	But that’s a possibility?	0
694	TRUMP	I don’t know — can I be honest?	0
695	TRUMP	I never even thought about it.	0
696	TRUMP	I never even thought about it.	0
697	COOPER	Okay.	0
698	TRUMP	Just seems to me the way the lawyers set it up.	0
699	TRUMP	But I am in right now, I put in my money, about $35 million.	0
700	TRUMP	I think in terms of small donations, I think we’ve received $6 million up until this point.	0
701	COOPER	I think I saw $7 million.	0
702	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
703	TRUMP	A lot of that is the selling of merchandise and things like that.	0
704	COOPER	I want to…	0
705	TRUMP	There’s no influence over me.	0
706	TRUMP	It’s not like the banks are giving me money and I’m going to do favors for the banks.	0
707	TRUMP	You look at Ted Cruz, the banks are giving him a lot of money.	0
708	TRUMP	The oil and gas are giving him a lot of money.	0
709	TRUMP	A lot of people are giving him a lot of money.	0
710	TRUMP	And by the way super PACs are a disaster, and they’re a disaster waiting to happen, folks, and if they’re not gotten rid of, it’s only going to get worse.	0
711	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
712	COOPER	I want to introduce you to Amelia Roll (ph).	0
713	COOPER	She’s a journalism student the University of Wisconsin.	0
714	COOPER	She says her first choice is Senator Cruz, but you’re her second pick.	0
715	TRUMP	Oh, that’s nice.	0
716	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
717	COOPER	Here’s your chance to win her over — Amelia.	0
718	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being here tonight.	0
719	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
720	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, you said that the U.S. should become a diminishing presence in NATO.	0
721	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
722	COOPER	Why do you think that the U.S. should start to withdraw their world presence from NATO, and what would you change about the organization so that we could remain involved?	0
723	TRUMP	Okay, I did two basic and very large interviews recently.	0
724	TRUMP	I did the New York Times, which treated me unbelievably fairly.	0
725	TRUMP	And there was a front-page story on Sunday or — I think, and It was a great story.	0
726	TRUMP	And part of it was NATO — and the other was the Washington Post.	0
727	COOPER	I think you talked to them longer than any other candidate, by the way, on the Republican side.	0
728	TRUMP	I spoke to the Times?	0
729	COOPER	Yes.	0
730	TRUMP	Well, I spoke to them a long time.	0
731	TRUMP	David, he’s a very talented writer actually.	0
732	TRUMP	And they treated me very fairly.	0
733	TRUMP	I also did the Washington Post, where I said very similar things, and very similar things about NATO.	0
734	TRUMP	Let me tell you, NATO is obsolete.	0
735	TRUMP	It was 67 years, or it’s over 60 years old.	0
736	TRUMP	It is — many countries, doesn’t cover terrorism, okay?	0
737	TRUMP	it covers the Soviet Union which is no longer in existence.	0
738	TRUMP	And NATO has to either be rejiggered, changed for the better.	0
739	TRUMP	I’m not saying — the other thing that’s bad about NATO, we’re paying too much.	0
740	TRUMP	We’re spending a tremendous — billions and billions of dollars on NATO.	0
741	COOPER	You’re saying it’s obsolete, though.	0
742	COOPER	You have now Vladimir Putin invade invading Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine — annexing Crimea.	0
743	TRUMP	Let me tell you about Ukraine.	0
744	TRUMP	First of all…	0
745	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
746	COOPER	There a lot of people who believe NATO is more important…	0
747	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
748	TRUMP	You have countries that surround Ukraine.	0
749	TRUMP	They don’t talk.	0
750	TRUMP	They don’t seem to have a problem.	0
751	TRUMP	I’m not saying go in.	0
752	TRUMP	I’d say be very strong, you can be strong without necessarily even being (INAUDIBLE) or the money we spend.	0
753	TRUMP	The money we spend is astronomical on NATO.	0
754	TRUMP	Okay?	0
755	TRUMP	The Ukraine —	0
756	COOPER	You really think NATO is obsolete?	0
757	TRUMP	I think it’s largely obsolete, yes.	0
758	TRUMP	It’s got to be changed.	0
759	TRUMP	It’s got to be — you don’t talk about terror.	0
760	TRUMP	Our single biggest threat right now is terror, okay?	0
761	TRUMP	Now that’s an amorphous term, but it’s terror.	0
762	TRUMP	Our single biggest threat —	0
763	COOPER	So you would like to see an organization revamped, either NATO —	0
764	TRUMP	Either revamped – NATO, now if you do that, you’re going to have to obviously have to add different nations in because you have nations that aren’t in NATO that are very much into the world of terror.	0
765	TRUMP	Both in terms of causing it and receiving it.	0
766	TRUMP	So you’d probably have to either start something or you have to do something.	0
767	TRUMP	When you look at Brussels, hey, look.	0
768	TRUMP	You remember a couple of months ago, I made a statement about Brussels.	0
769	TRUMP	I said it’s a hell hole.	0
770	TRUMP	That’s because it’s a financial, very big  financial capital.	0
771	TRUMP	Many of my friends are there.	0
772	TRUMP	They know exactly what’s going on.	0
773	TRUMP	I haven’t been there in many years.	0
774	TRUMP	I was there.	0
775	TRUMP	It was a beautiful city.	0
776	TRUMP	Now it’s not good.	0
777	TRUMP	And I said it was a hell hole.	0
778	TRUMP	“The New York Times” attacked me rather viciously for calling a place a hell hole.	0
779	TRUMP	Two months later, we had the attack, and it turned out I was right.	0
780	TRUMP	It’s a hell hole.	0
781	TRUMP	And on Twitter and all over the place, they’re saying Trump was right, Trump was right.	0
782	TRUMP	I understand this stuff.	0
783	TRUMP	I mean, I really do understand this stuff.	0
784	TRUMP	NATO is obsolete.	0
785	TRUMP	Now, that doesn’t mean it can’t be rejiggered and it can’t be fixed and made good or —	0
786	COOPER	And for you that’s —	0
787	TRUMP	It’s possible —	0
788	COOPER	— a financial component that when you talk about —	0
789	TRUMP	We’re paying too much!	0
790	TRUMP	You have countries in NATO, I think it’s 28 countries – you have countries in NATO that are getting a free ride and it’s unfair, it’s very unfair.	0
791	TRUMP	The United States cannot afford to be the policemen of the world anymore, folks.	0
792	TRUMP	We have to rebuild our own country.	0
793	TRUMP	We have to stop with this stuff.	0
794	TRUMP	You have as an example, Ukraine.	0
795	TRUMP	You don’t have Germany talking about Ukraine.	0
796	TRUMP	You don’t have many of the countries in NATO talking about — it’s always us.	0
797	TRUMP	We’re always the first one out.	0
798	TRUMP	We have very big problems in our country.	0
799	TRUMP	Very, very big problems.	0
800	TRUMP	NATO has to be either changed, or we have to do something.	0
801	TRUMP	And we shouldn’t be paying most of the course of NATO because it’s unfair – it’s unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.	0
802	COOPER	We’ve got to – we’ve got to take a quick break.	0
803	COOPER	We’ll have more with Donald Trump right after the short break when our 360 Republican Town Hall continues from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee.	0
804	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
805	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
806	COOPER	And, welcome back.	0
807	COOPER	We’re talking to Donald Trump.	0
808	COOPER	A week before the Wisconsin primary, voters asking the Republican candidates the questions that matter to them, looking for answers to help them decide.	0
809	COOPER	Before we go back to the audience, I want to ask you a question I asked to Senator Cruz as well.	0
810	COOPER	more than six months ago you pledged to support the Republican nominee, whoever that may be.	0
811	COOPER	A lot has changed since then.	0
812	COOPER	It sounded, when I was pressing Senator Cruz on it, sounded like he was saying he was saying he’d have a hard time supporting somebody who went after his wife.	1
813	TRUMP	Honestly, he doesn’t have to support me.	0
814	TRUMP	I’m not asking for his support.	0
815	TRUMP	I want the people’s support.	0
816	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
817	COOPER	Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is?	0
818	TRUMP	No.	0
819	TRUMP	I don’t anymore.	0
820	COOPER	You don’t?	0
821	TRUMP	No, we’ll see who it is.	0
822	COOPER	You won’t promise to support the Republican nominee?	0
823	TRUMP	He was essentially saying the same thing.	0
824	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, he doesn’t have to support me.	0
825	TRUMP	I have tremendous support right now from the people.	0
826	TRUMP	I’m way over two million votes more than him.	0
827	TRUMP	I have many, many, more delegates than him.	0
828	TRUMP	Like, many, many more delegates.	0
829	TRUMP	As I said before, he was talking about his great victory the night Utah — well, I won Arizona.	0
830	TRUMP	Many more delegates.	0
831	TRUMP	Many, many more delegates.	0
832	TRUMP	I don’t really want him to do something he’s not comfortable with.	0
833	TRUMP	Just like I can’t imagine Jeb Bush — look, I beat these people badly.	0
834	TRUMP	I beat Jeb Bush.	0
835	TRUMP	I beat the governor of this state, the governor of this state came in, he was favored to win.	0
836	TRUMP	He was at 22 points.	0
837	TRUMP	Then he said something bad about me and I hit him very hard, and he went boom, and he left the race.	0
838	TRUMP	He was very early…	0
839	COOPER	…Just so I’m clear…	0
840	TRUMP	I don’t want to make people uncomfortable.	0
841	TRUMP	I don’t need their support.	0
842	TRUMP	Now, maybe it will be a negative, maybe it won’t.	0
843	COOPER	So, the pledge you took is null and void.	0
844	COOPER	The idea of supporting whoever…	0
845	TRUMP	…  I have defeated…	0
846	COOPER	…  the Republican nominee is, you say you will no longer guarantee you will support the Republican nominee…	0
847	TRUMP	…  I have been treated very unfairly.	0
848	TRUMP	I won the state of Missouri, right?	0
849	TRUMP	No, I have.	0
850	TRUMP	Aww, Cruz people.	0
851	TRUMP	I’ve been treated very unfairly.	0
852	COOPER	Unfairly by?	0
853	TRUMP	I’ll give you an example.	0
854	COOPER	Who?	0
855	TRUMP	I think by, basically, the RNC, the Republican party, the establishment.	0
856	TRUMP	You have a guy like Mitt Romney who lost miserably, who did a terrible job.	0
857	TRUMP	He was a horrible, horrible campaign.	0
858	TRUMP	The last month of that — I helped him.	0
859	TRUMP	I raised him a million dollars…	0
860	COOPER	…  Do you think the RNC is plotting to take this away from you at the convention?	0
861	TRUMP	I don’t know, I don’t know.	0
862	TRUMP	I mean, we’ll see what happens, but I think you’d have a lot of very upset people if that happened.	0
863	TRUMP	Just so you understand, when Romney came out against me he ran one of the worst races in the history of presidential politics.	0
864	TRUMP	He ought to sit back and root for us instead of being a negative force.	0
865	TRUMP	And, we have, others also.	0
866	TRUMP	I’m bringing millions — the biggest story in all of politics worldwide right now — and I think you might agree to this, is what’s happened.	0
867	TRUMP	Millions of people are coming in and voting, in all fairness, for me.	0
868	COOPER	And, watching, and being involved in the process.	0
869	TRUMP	And, watching all of this.	0
870	TRUMP	Your ratings tonight will be excellent, right?	0
871	TRUMP	The debate you had where 23 million people, I don’t want to say this tragedy, I’m just telling you, if I wasn’t in it you would have had, what?	0
872	TRUMP	Four million people…	0
873	COOPER	…  In the off chance that you’re not the Republican nominee, what would go into your decision of whether or not you would support…	0
874	TRUMP	…  Well, I’ll look at it.	0
875	TRUMP	I’ll see who it is.	0
876	TRUMP	I mean, I’m not looking to hurt anybody.	0
877	TRUMP	I love the Republican party as…	0
878	COOPER	…  If it’s Senator Ted Cruz, would you support him…	0
879	TRUMP	…  Look, here’s my thing on Cruz.	0
880	TRUMP	A lot of nasty things have been said.	0
881	TRUMP	I’m a very honorably guy, and I’m a very honest guy.	0
882	TRUMP	I don’t do — I would have never done what he did to Ben Carson who, by the way, endorsed me.	0
883	TRUMP	I would have never gone to Iowa and said, “Ben Carson has left the race”.	0
884	TRUMP	He is gone, 100 percent, vote for me.	0
885	TRUMP	And they usher people into the caucus, and they try and get them to vote for Ted Cruz.	0
886	TRUMP	A lot of people left Ben Carson.	0
887	TRUMP	Ben Carson is an honorable guy.	0
888	TRUMP	That was a terrible thing to do.	0
889	TRUMP	There were other terrible things to do.	0
890	TRUMP	And I — honestly, I watched him tonight with you, and I  watched how tormented he was when you asked him that question.	0
891	TRUMP	I don’t want to have him torment.	0
892	TRUMP	I don’t want to have him be tormented.	0
893	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, I don’t want his support.	0
894	TRUMP	I don’t need his support.	0
895	TRUMP	I want him to be comfortable.	0
896	TRUMP	Now, if he wants to support me, that would be wonderful because I think I’m going to win.	0
897	TRUMP	But let me just tell you.	0
898	TRUMP	I watched him, you know, skirt around like any politician would.	0
899	TRUMP	Skirt around the issue.	0
900	TRUMP	I don’t want to make people like Jeb Bush, like Ted Cruz, like Governor Walker — I mean, Governor Walker, I hit him very hard after he hit me.	0
901	TRUMP	But I hit him very hard and drove him out of the race.	0
902	TRUMP	I drove Jeb Bush out of the race.	0
903	TRUMP	I drove Rand Paul out of the race.	0
904	TRUMP	I understand why they don’t like me.	0
905	TRUMP	And I don’t want people that — I don’t want people to do something against their will, Anderson.	0
906	TRUMP	I could see that he was having a hard time with a very simple question that you asked him.	0
907	TRUMP	Would you support, well, I think I’m going to win.	0
908	TRUMP	OK.	0
909	TRUMP	He doesn’t have to do it.	0
910	TRUMP	He doesn’t have to support me.	0
911	TRUMP	I really don’t believe I need his support.	0
912	TRUMP	I’d love to have everybody’s support.	0
913	TRUMP	You know what, I’m a unifier.	0
914	TRUMP	Believe it or not, I’m a unifier.	0
915	TRUMP	And you will see that.	0
916	TRUMP	Someday you will see that.	0
917	COOPER	If there was a contested convention, and you didn’t get the nomination, and someone else was brought in, a Paul Ryan, for instance, would you support him?	0
918	TRUMP	Well, let me explain.	0
919	TRUMP	See, he was very nice.	0
920	TRUMP	He called me the other day, last week, and he was very nice.	0
921	TRUMP	But then I read reports that he’s having meetings with people about, you know, some clandestine things.	0
922	TRUMP	Let’s see what happens.	0
923	TRUMP	But he was very nice when he called.	0
924	TRUMP	And I assume he was being straight with me.	0
925	TRUMP	I hope he was being straight with me because what he said was very appropriate.	0
926	TRUMP	I’m the front-runner by a lot.	0
927	TRUMP	I’m beating Ted Cruz by millions of votes.	0
928	TRUMP	Millions of votes.	0
929	TRUMP	The Republican Party is doing — it’s a phenomena.	0
930	TRUMP	And this was not going to that with the Republican Party.	0
931	TRUMP	People that never voted before, Democrats and independents, are pouring in and voting for me.	0
932	COOPER	In Louisiana, you won…	0
933	TRUMP	I won.	0
934	COOPER	But Ted Cruz got…	0
935	TRUMP	To show you how corrupt the system is…	0
936	COOPER	… got more delegates.	0
937	COOPER	You threatened to sue.	0
938	TRUMP	I won — well, I’m going to see.	0
939	TRUMP	I mean, I never heard of that before.	0
940	TRUMP	You know, I’m a very — I’m an American.	0
941	TRUMP	If you win an election, you’re supposed to…	0
942	COOPER	But isn’t that just sour grapes?	0
943	COOPER	Didn’t he just have…	0
944	TRUMP	No.	0
945	COOPER	He just outworked you on the ground in getting delegates?	0
946	TRUMP	No.	0
947	TRUMP	Now let me tell you what’s next.	0
948	TRUMP	No, no.	0
949	TRUMP	Look, in Missouri, I just — it was just announced I won.	0
950	TRUMP	I figured, in fact, they actually found that after a tabulation that I got 300 and some odd more votes than I had the first time, which is, you know, after two weeks or three weeks of tabulation, which gives me another 12 or 13 delegates.	0
951	TRUMP	It was just announced a little while ago just before I went on the air.	0
952	TRUMP	I will say this, Louisiana, I went to Louisiana.	0
953	TRUMP	I have a great relationship with the people of Louisiana.	0
954	TRUMP	They’re great people.	0
955	TRUMP	I won the election.	0
956	TRUMP	I was down there the night before.	0
957	TRUMP	We had an airplane hangar, you wouldn’t believe it, packed with people screaming.	0
958	TRUMP	I won the election.	0
959	TRUMP	And then it’s all about the delegates.	0
960	TRUMP	So I won.	0
961	TRUMP	And then I found out that I got 10 votes less  — 10 delegates less than the guy who lost.	0
962	TRUMP	I beat him rather easily.	0
963	COOPER	But those are the rules.	0
964	COOPER	I mean, his campaign had a better ground game in Louisiana.	0
965	TRUMP	No, I don’t know what rules — OK, I don’t know, I don’t think — I don’t call it a ground game.	0
966	TRUMP	I call it bad politics.	0
967	COOPER	They were able to get more delegates.	0
968	TRUMP	I call it bad politics.	0
969	TRUMP	When somebody goes in and wins the election and gets less delegates than the guy that lost, I don’t think that’s right.	0
970	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
971	COOPER	All right.	0
972	COOPER	I want you to meet Jim Zaiser, he’s the CEO of a valve manufacturing company that has been in the family for three generations.	0
973	COOPER	He says he’s undecided.	0
974	COOPER	He’s leaning in your favor.	0
975	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
976	TRUMP	That’s what I like to hear.	0
977	QUESTION	Hello, Mr. Trump.	0
978	QUESTION	As a world leader, any leader, you need compassion and a willingness to make compromises.	0
979	QUESTION	Can you give me an example of a time you have learned from your behavior and changed the way you have done something going forward?	0
980	TRUMP	Yes.	0
981	TRUMP	I am somebody — Jim, thank you.	0
982	TRUMP	I am somebody that believes in flexibility.	0
983	TRUMP	And if you notice, Ted Cruz and mostly him, he says he will change, he will negotiate, he will this.	0
984	TRUMP	Look, you don’t have to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for a day-and-a-half and rant and rave while all the other senators are laughing at you, and by the way, not endorsing him.	0
985	TRUMP	Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected men in the Senate, endorsed me, and frankly — I mean, and he’s a great man.	0
986	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
987	TRUMP	And by the way, Jeff Sessions is a great man with great, great knowledge.	0
988	TRUMP	And Ted Cruz thought he was going to get that endorsement.	0
989	TRUMP	He would speak about Jeff Sessions all the time, then Jeff Sessions came out and endorsed me.	0
990	TRUMP	You need flexibility, and I talk about it all the time.	0
991	TRUMP	You need to be able to negotiate great deals.	0
992	TRUMP	You know, it’s not all about signing  executive orders because this is something that came in — that wasn’t the way our founders thought that this country was going to win.	0
993	TRUMP	You have to get — now, I’ll make great deals.	0
994	TRUMP	I’ll make conservative deals.	0
995	TRUMP	I’m going to make wonderful deals but you have to do it the old-fashioned way like Ronald Reagan did with Tip O’Neill.	0
996	COOPER	Do you have a specific, though, for him on — a specific example that you changed your behavior, changed the way you’ve done something going forward, or learned from something you’ve done that you didn’t like the way it turned out?	0
997	TRUMP	Well, I think — yeah, I mean, I have many, many things that I’ve done.	0
998	TRUMP	I have many things that I’ve changed course on.	0
999	TRUMP	I mean, I’ve changed course on many, many things.	0
1000	TRUMP	I was not…	0
1001	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1002	TRUMP	Actually, I have.	0
1003	COOPER	Any specifics?	0
1004	TRUMP	Well, I mean, you could say, I am — as you know, I’m pro-life, and I was originally pro-choice.	0
1005	TRUMP	I will say this, that as a developer and as a businessman I’m not sure I was ever even asked the question, are you pro-life, pro-choice?	0
1006	TRUMP	And it was not something that as one of magazines recently said, Donald Trump is a world-class businessman.	0
1007	TRUMP	He was never asked those questions before.	0
1008	TRUMP	But you know, if I was asked those questions years ago it’s something I never really gave much though to.	0
1009	TRUMP	But I’ve made certain changes.	0
1010	TRUMP	I have evolved.	0
1011	TRUMP	I talk about evolving all the time.	0
1012	COOPER	I want to…	0
1013	TRUMP	And by the way, you know who else evolved, is Ronald Reagan evolved.	0
1014	TRUMP	Because Ronald Reagan signed one of the toughest abortion laws in favor of abortion in California that had been signed in many, many years.	0
1015	TRUMP	And yet has a great president and a — pretty conservative — he wasn’t very conservative, but he was a pretty conservative president.	0
1016	COOPER	You said on the radio right here in Wisconsin the other day that you do apologize and you believe in apologizing.	0
1017	COOPER	When was the last time you actually apologized for something?	0
1018	TRUMP	Oh, wow.	0
1019	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1020	TRUMP	No, I do — I don’t know — I’ll think.	0
1021	TRUMP	Can I think?	0
1022	TRUMP	But look, I do believe in apologizing, if you’re wrong.	0
1023	TRUMP	But if you’re not wrong, I don’t believe in apologizing.	0
1024	TRUMP	For instance, I could have apologized, you brought up — we started this with Corey, my campaign manager.	0
1025	TRUMP	Will you apologize.	0
1026	TRUMP	I said, apologize for what?	0
1027	TRUMP	I see the tape.	0
1028	TRUMP	Apologize for what?	0
1029	TRUMP	I’ve love to apologize.	0
1030	TRUMP	It would be so much easier.	0
1031	TRUMP	Apologize, Corey, you’re fired…	0
1032	COOPER	But you don’t know any specific examples that you’ve apologized, ever.	0
1033	TRUMP	Yes, I mean — apologized — I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language.	0
1034	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1035	TRUMP	I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion.	0
1036	TRUMP	She’s always saying “Darling, be more presidential.”	0
1037	COOPER	She told me she’s talked to you about that.	0
1038	TRUMP	No, she does, because she thinks I’m very presidential.	0
1039	TRUMP	The last debate — and by the way, Cruz talked about I don’t want to — I debated this guy like 112 (ph) times.	0
1040	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1041	COOPER	She didn’t like you reusing the word, a dirty word, or a bad word I guess — I sound like a 12-year-old…	0
1042	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1043	COOPER	… that somebody in your audience shouted out and you repeated.	0
1044	COOPER	She didn’t like that.	0
1045	TRUMP	Oh, she didn’t like that.	0
1046	TRUMP	And really, it was just a repeat, but that didn’t work out too well.	0
1047	TRUMP	No, she didn’t…	0
1048	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1049	TRUMP	Repeats don’t work either.	0
1050	TRUMP	And it wasn’t horrible.	0
1051	COOPER	What is it with you, like, repeats and retweets don’t count.	0
1052	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1053	TRUMP	Do you ever notice my biggest problems are repeats and retweets.	0
1054	TRUMP	I don’t in problem with what I say; it’s when I repeat such…	0
1055	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1056	COOPER	Well, maybe that’s one of those things you should learn from your behavior and not retweet things.	0
1057	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1058	TRUMP	You’re right.	0
1059	TRUMP	You’re right.	0
1060	TRUMP	That I agree with.	0
1061	COOPER	Some free advice.	0
1062	TRUMP	That I agree with.	0
1063	TRUMP	I will say this, though, my wife and Ivanka said, like, on the last debates, because the debates had been pretty rough and really I felt  I had to be rough, because it’s coming at me from all different angles.	0
1064	TRUMP	Don’t forget I’ve been at the middle of the podium, the middle of the stage for every single debate.	0
1065	TRUMP	I’ve enjoyed debate — I never debated…	0
1066	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1067	COOPER	Cruz has challenged you to debate him.	0
1068	TRUMP	Give me a break.	0
1069	TRUMP	The guy has challenged me – he’s lost every debate.	0
1070	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1071	COOPER	You wouldn’t debate him one on one?	0
1072	TRUMP	I think we’ve had enough questions from the same people, including you — and all due respect.	0
1073	COOPER	I haven’t done a GOP debate yet, but that’s all right.	0
1074	TRUMP	How many times can the same people — how many times, Anderson, can the same people ask the same question?	0
1075	TRUMP	It’s just —  you get tired of it.	0
1076	COOPER	But as president you’re going to be asked the same question for four or eight years.	0
1077	TRUMP	I’ve had 11 or 12 debates — wait a minute — I’ve had 11 or 12 debates with Cruz.	0
1078	TRUMP	Every — Drudge, they do an online poll right after the debate, Time magazine, Slate, many groups do — I think I’ve won every single poll by a lot on debating.	0
1079	TRUMP	I have nothing to prove anymore.	0
1080	COOPER	So no more debates?	0
1081	TRUMP	I don’t see where it’s necessary.	0
1082	TRUMP	I mean, look, you’re asking me all of these questions tonight.	0
1083	TRUMP	Frankly, I think this is much better than a debate.	0
1084	TRUMP	The debates, they give you 15 seconds, what would you do in terms of war and peace, okay?	0
1085	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1086	TRUMP	Honestly, i Think this is a much better format.	0
1087	COOPER	I’m happy to keep having these conversations.	0
1088	TRUMP	I don’t think it’s easier.	0
1089	TRUMP	I think debating is probably easier because you’re talking so little.	0
1090	COOPER	I want to bring in.	0
1091	COOPER	Sorry…	0
1092	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1093	TRUMP	So I hope you change your mind.	0
1094	TRUMP	I hope you’re can agree (ph) with me.	0
1095	COOPER	Sorry, hold on.	0
1096	COOPER	Sorry, John.	0
1097	COOPER	I want you to meet John Peghill (ph).	0
1098	COOPER	Thanks very much.	0
1099	TRUMP	Yes, hi, John.	0
1100	COOPER	He’s a dairy farmer.	0
1101	COOPER	He’s got 5,000 cows.	0
1102	COOPER	We have another dairy farmer asking a question for Senator Cruz earlier.	0
1103	COOPER	John said he’s leaning in your favor.	0
1104	COOPER	Still listening to the other candidates.	0
1105	COOPER	John, welcome.	0
1106	TRUMP	Hi, John.	0
1107	QUESTION	Mr. Trump — hi.	0
1108	QUESTION	Welcome to the Cheese State.	0
1109	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1110	TRUMP	A great state.	0
1111	COOPER	The question that I have — Wisconsin is an amazing state.	0
1112	COOPER	But our No.	0
1113	COOPER	1 economic driver, which is the dairy industry and the cheese industry is right behind it, is being challenged right now by having a labor force dependent on an immigration policy.	0
1114	COOPER	And we’ve got over 10,000 farms in this state.	0
1115	COOPER	And with there being such a strong economic driver, if we don’t have a strong immigration policy that will give us the opportunity to keep the ones that we have and provide a vehicle to bring new ones in from Mexico legally…	0
1116	TRUMP	Legally.	0
1117	TRUMP	You said the word.	0
1118	COOPER	Yes, but can you develop a policy that will give us that, give us the people that we have here to stay here and do the jobs — and create a policy that can bring people in to fill the jobs?	0
1119	COOPER	We’re down to 3.5 percent unemployment rate North of Milwaukee, so that we can’t steal any more people from someone else’s industry, because that’s what everybody’s doing at this point.	0
1120	COOPER	How do we fill the jobs, the good paying jobs?	0
1121	COOPER	How do we fill those jobs?	0
1122	TRUMP	Here’s where you are, you’re in the same position as the California grape growers because they need people to come in.	0
1123	TRUMP	It’s seasonal, in that case.	0
1124	TRUMP	Very seasonal, less seasonal in your case, but still seasonal.	0
1125	TRUMP	And, people will be able — if they can’t get people, will be able to come in legally.	0
1126	TRUMP	See, you said the word.	0
1127	TRUMP	Right now we have illegal immigration, we have illegals all over the country.	0
1128	TRUMP	We have at least 11 million.	0
1129	TRUMP	Some people think it could be 31 million, it’s somewhere in between.	0
1130	TRUMP	It’s probably 12, 13, 14 — we have no idea what we’re doing.	0
1131	TRUMP	If you have an industry like California grapes, like perhaps what you’re talking about in Wisconsin, we’re going to let people come in, but they’re going to come in legally.	0
1132	TRUMP	They’re going to come in through a visa program and they’re going to come in legally.	0
1133	TRUMP	It’s going to work out beautifully, you will not be affected.	0
1134	TRUMP	We don’t want to affect businesses.	0
1135	TRUMP	We want to grow businesses.	0
1136	TRUMP	The other part of your question now, I think that we really have to talk about, is trade because a lot of people are sending goods over to other countries, and especially goods that can spoil like what you do.	0
1137	TRUMP	They send over to other countries, and the other country refuse to accept them, and yet we accept their good without tax, without anything.	0
1138	TRUMP	We are going to straighten out our trade policy so that you’re going to get a lot more business.	0
1139	COOPER	We have time for one more question from the audience.	0
1140	COOPER	This is Andy Bowen, she’s from Shorewood, and homeschools her two daughters.	0
1141	COOPER	She says she’s leaning in your favor for the primary next week.	0
1142	COOPER	Andy, welcome.	0
1143	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1144	TRUMP	Hi, Andy.	0
1145	QUESTION	Thank you, hi, Mr. Trump.	0
1146	QUESTION	My 93-year-old father is so impressed with all of your kids.	0
1147	TRUMP	That’s good.	0
1148	QUESTION	Especially with your two sons.	0
1149	QUESTION	And, when they’re on television being interviewed, he will often say, “Why can’t Donald Trump be more like his sons, who are so…”	0
1150	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1151	TRUMP	…  I hear that.	0
1152	TRUMP	I know.	0
1153	QUESTION	…  who are so well spoken, and calm.	0
1154	QUESTION	And, so my question to you, Mr. Trump, is could you possibly look to your sons as examples how not to be quite so reactionary?	0
1155	QUESTION	And, also, congratulations on raising such fine young people…	0
1156	TRUMP	…Thank you very much.	0
1157	TRUMP	I think I love that question, can I be honest?	0
1158	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1159	TRUMP	I have so many compliments on my children, and Ivanka is doing phenomenally well.	0
1160	TRUMP	My boys are great Baron is a young version, I think, of Eric, frankly, because they’re very tall, and they look alike, etcetera, etcetera.	0
1161	TRUMP	But, Don, and Eric, and Baron are just spectacular people, and you know?	0
1162	TRUMP	I get so many compliments.	0
1163	TRUMP	Ivanka, is Ivanka, you know?	0
1164	TRUMP	You know Ivanka very well, you’ve had her on your show, and she’s a star.	0
1165	TRUMP	She’s absolutely a start, and so supportive of me, and so supportive what I’m doing.	0
1166	TRUMP	And, they do have great attitude.	0
1167	TRUMP	I do, I get so many people come up to my office, and they want to have their children come up and meet me because they want their children to be like mine.	0
1168	COOPER	Do you sometimes wish you had a little bit more of what she called, “calmness”?	0
1169	TRUMP	My children have a lot of drive.	0
1170	TRUMP	You don’t want to see them sometimes, I will say this.	0
1171	TRUMP	They’re very strong.	0
1172	TRUMP	They are very — they have great heart.	0
1173	TRUMP	They have great heart.	0
1174	TRUMP	All of my children have a wonderful, wonderful feeling for people, they love people.	0
1175	TRUMP	That’s why they want me to do what I’m doing, because they know I’d do it well.	0
1176	TRUMP	They know I’ll bring the country — you know, we have the expression, “Make America Great Again”.	0
1177	TRUMP	They know I will make America Great again.	0
1178	TRUMP	The world isn’t going to take advantages of us anymore.	0
1179	TRUMP	You look at what the world is doing to us at every level, whether it’s militarily, or in trade, or in so many other levels, the world is taking advantage of the United States and it’s driving us into literally being a third world nation.	0
1180	TRUMP	Anderson, I travel all over the world, and I land at airports the likes of which you’ve never seen, whether it’s in Qatar, or Dubai, or places in China.	0
1181	TRUMP	The likes of which you have never seen, and then we come home and we land at LaGuardia with potholes all over the place, or LAX, or Kennedy, or Newark, and you look at what we have and where we’ve gone.	0
1182	TRUMP	It’s time to rebuild our country.	0
1183	COOPER	You just welcomed a new grandson…	0
1184	TRUMP	… And I really appreciate your statement.	0
1185	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1186	COOPER	You just welcomed a new grandson…	0
1187	TRUMP	I did.	0
1188	COOPER	His name is Theodore.	0
1189	COOPER	Any chance you’re going to call him Crying Ted?	0
1190	TRUMP	No, I don’t think so.	0
1191	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1192	TRUMP	I said — well, actually, isn’t Ted’s real name Raphael?	0
1193	TRUMP	I think so, right?	0
1194	TRUMP	Because that was one of the questions did have to ask.	0
1195	COOPER	I — it is.	0
1196	TRUMP	I doesn’t matter.	0
1197	TRUMP	Theodore Roosevelt is somebody Jared and Ivanka have long studied and respected, and it’s Theodore James.	0
1198	TRUMP	Tough, strong, and it’s Theodore James, and that’s what they really had in mind.	0
