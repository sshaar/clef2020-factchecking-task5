1	COOPER	Welcome to all of you who are joining us.	0
2	COOPER	We’re here with the three remaining Republican candidates.	0
3	COOPER	In the audience tonight Republican and some independents, all of whom say they are voting in next week’s Republican primary.	0
4	COOPER	Some have already made their decisions on a candidate, others still undecided.	0
5	COOPER	They came up with the questions you’ll hear tonight.	0
6	COOPER	We reviewed them to make sure the questions don’t overlap.	0
7	COOPER	I’m going to ask a few questions as well, but tonight this town hall is a chance for voters to hear at length from the candidates.	0
8	COOPER	So, let’s get right to it.	0
9	COOPER	Joining us right now, the U.S.	0
10	COOPER	Senator from Texas.	0
11	COOPER	Please welcome Ted Cruz.	0
12	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
13	COOPER	Welcome.	0
14	CRUZ	Thank you, good to be with you.	0
15	COOPER	Congratulations on a big endorsement from the governor of the state, Scott Walker.	0
16	COOPER	Obviously a great thing for your campaign.	0
17	COOPER	We’re going to hear a lot of questions tonight from the voters on the issues.	0
18	COOPER	I want to just start by talking to you about a couple of issues of the day.	0
19	COOPER	As you know, you talked a little bit today, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski (ph), charged today with Simple Battery.	0
20	COOPER	If he was your campaign manager, would you ask him to resign?	0
21	CRUZ	Of course.	0
22	CRUZ	Look, it shouldn’t be complicated that members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press.	0
23	CRUZ	I mean, that shouldn’t be a complicated decision.	0
24	COOPER	He says he’s innocent of all the charges.	0
25	CRUZ	Well…	0
26	COOPER	…  Do you believe it was assault?	0
27	CRUZ	He has just been charged.	0
28	CRUZ	I know that the reporter alleged that she was physically assaulted.	0
29	CRUZ	That I will say, it’s consistent with the pattern of the Trump campaign.	0
30	COOPER	Do you think it says something about the campaign itself?	0
31	COOPER	About the leadership?	0
32	CRUZ	The culture of the campaign has been a campaign built on attacks, on insults, and I think there is no place in politics for insults, for personal attacks, for going to the gutter, and there should be no place for physical violence either.	0
33	COOPER	I want to ask you about the path ahead for you.	0
34	COOPER	you need 85 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination.	0
35	COOPER	Not impossible, but highly improbable.	0
36	COOPER	Will you admit tonight that a contested convention is your best bet to get the nomination?	0
37	CRUZ	Not remotely because…	0
38	COOPER	Do you think you can get 85 percent?	0
39	CRUZ	Absolutely, and our path going forward is to get 1,237.	0
40	CRUZ	Most of the races coming up are either winner-take-all, or winner-take-most.	0
41	COOPER	But, you’ve only gotten 30 percent of the delegates so far.	0
42	COOPER	We’re half over.	0
43	CRUZ	Well…	0
44	COOPER	…  How do you go from 30 percent to 85 percent?	0
45	CRUZ	I’ll tell you, the way you do that — it’s the situation.	0
46	CRUZ	If two guys are hiking in the woods, and a bear start chasing, and you know the old joke that the fellow sits down and starts to put on his running shoes?	0
47	CRUZ	And the guy turns to his friend and says, “What are you doing?	0
48	CRUZ	You can’t outrun the bear.”	0
49	CRUZ	And, the guy says, “I don’t have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you.”	0
50	CRUZ	That principal is the same thing going forward, if we continue to beat Donald Trump — you know, we just had a few days ago in Utah a massive victory against Donald Trump and we got all of the delegates in Utah.	0
51	CRUZ	If we continue to beat Donald Trump going forward most of the states are winner-take-all or winner-take-most, and we get North of 80 percent of the delegates simply by beating Donald Trump going forward.	0
52	COOPER	But Donald Trump is still way out in front of you.	0
53	COOPER	He won Louisiana.	0
54	COOPER	You got more delegates out of Louisiana, which he is obviously upset about, but I mean, 85 percent in the remaining races, that’s more than you’ve ever gotten anywhere.	0
55	CRUZ	Look, but you don’t have to win 85 percent, Anderson.	0
56	CRUZ	The way it works, you have to win the races going forward but when you win, you get most or all the delegates.	0
57	CRUZ	And here’s the dynamic that has played out.	0
58	CRUZ	A year ago there were 17 candidates.	0
59	CRUZ	It was a fantastic, diverse, dynamic field.	0
60	CRUZ	The field has narrowed now.	0
61	CRUZ	And what Donald benefits from is division because Donald has had pretty consistently a floor of about 20 to 25 percent.	0
62	CRUZ	But he has got a hard ceiling of about 35 to 40 percent that he has a real hard time breaking.	0
63	CRUZ	And so when there are two or three or four other candidates and they divide the vote, he can win state after state with 30, 35 percent, even 40 percent.	0
64	CRUZ	Head to head, Donald has an incredibly difficult time breaking 50 percent.	0
65	COOPER	The Kasich campaign has made an effort to reach out to your campaign to strike some sort of a pact in order to defeat Donald Trump.	0
66	COOPER	Wouldn’t that make sense?	0
67	COOPER	Apparently all the reports are so far you’ve not responded.	0
68	CRUZ	Well, it makes no sense at all.	0
69	CRUZ	John Kasich has no path to win it.	0
70	CRUZ	We are competing to win.	0
71	CRUZ	We’re not competing to stop Trump.	0
72	CRUZ	We’re competing to win the nomination.	0
73	CRUZ	John Kasich went 0 for 27.	0
74	CRUZ	He lost 27 states in a row.	0
75	COOPER	He admits though it’s going to go to a contested convention, that’s where he says he can win.	0
76	CRUZ	Look, I understand, except that it’s against the rules for John Kasich to be on the ballot.	0
77	CRUZ	The rules provide that in order to be even on the ballot, if no one has 1,237, you have to have won at least 8 states.	0
78	CRUZ	Now, there are only two candidates who are going to meet that threshold, Donald Trump and me.	0
79	CRUZ	And so our preferred option is win 1,237 delegates before the convention.	0
80	CRUZ	We are working hard to do that.	0
81	CRUZ	And I’ll mention Wisconsin is going to be critical in that.	0
82	CRUZ	But the second option, which is entirely possible, we could get to a convention where nobody has 1,237 delegates, and we come in with a ton of delegates, Donald Trump comes in with a ton of delegates.	0
83	CRUZ	And if that happens, then it becomes a battle for the delegates, but the only two names on the ballot are going to be Donald Trump and me.	0
84	CRUZ	On the rules, those are the only two people that can be voted on.	0
85	CRUZ	And I think in that situation, we’re in a very strong position to earn the 1,237 votes from the delegates who are elected by the people.	0
86	COOPER	I want to talk about some policy here.	0
87	COOPER	In the wake of the horrible attacks that we saw in Brussels, you proposed securing our borders, crushing ISIS, stopping refugees.	0
88	COOPER	But you also suggested that law enforcement “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” John Kasich said about that proposal: “So what we want to do is start policing Muslim neighborhoods, create more divisions, start policing neighborhoods in here La Crosse?	0
89	COOPER	This is politics trying to appeal to people’s base instincts and fears.”	0
90	COOPER	Is that what you’re doing?	0
91	CRUZ	Look, what I believe we should do is we need a commander-in-chief who is actually focused on keeping this country safe.	0
92	CRUZ	You know, we saw…	0
93	COOPER	What does it mean, though, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods”?	0
94	COOPER	How do you decide what neighborhoods — what’s a Muslim neighborhood?	0
95	CRUZ	Let me answer your question.	0
96	CRUZ	We had a terror attack in Brussels last week.	0
97	CRUZ	It was a horrific attack.	0
98	CRUZ	President Obama could barely be bothered to stop his baseball game with communist dictators to say anything about it.	0
99	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
100	CRUZ	And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words “radical Islamic” terrorism.	1
101	CRUZ	Instead what he does, what he did after the Paris terror attack, what he did after San Bernardino, is he goes on television and he lectures Americans about Islamophobia.	0
102	CRUZ	Enough is enough.	0
103	CRUZ	How about a president that actually stands up and defends this country?	0
104	CRUZ	We need a commander-in-chief…	0
105	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
106	COOPER	So what does that mean, patrol Muslim neighborhoods?	0
107	CRUZ	What it means is that we target the enemy.	0
108	CRUZ	Now, there is a difference between Islam and Islamism.	0
109	CRUZ	Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad, to murder or to forcibly convert all infidels.	0
110	CRUZ	And by infidels, they mean every one of the rest of us.	0
111	CRUZ	Islamism is our enemy.	0
112	CRUZ	And when President Obama and Hillary Clinton and the modern Democratic Party play this politically correct game of denying it, it means they don’t fight it effectively.	0
113	CRUZ	So, for example, let’s talk about the consequences of it.	0
114	CRUZ	Obama and Hillary both advocate bringing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America.	0
115	COOPER	Right, so you want to stop that, but you did talk about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods.	0
116	CRUZ	Sure, absolutely.	0
117	COOPER	And a lot of folks — you kept saying that worked in New York, but political correctness made the police stop that.	0
118	CRUZ	Yes.	0
119	COOPER	New York Police have pushed back on that.	0
120	COOPER	Chief Bratton said that’s just complete bunk.	0
121	COOPER	And I want to read you what, in fact — I mean, the guy who ran that program that you say was such a big success says it didn’t lead to any prosecutions, there were no leads from it.	0
122	CRUZ	Listen, you are right that after I called for increased vigilance protecting us that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio all attacked me.	0
123	CRUZ	I wear that as a badge of pride.	0
124	CRUZ	I will not apologize to anyone…	0
125	COOPER	… Bill Bratton, worked for Rudy Giuliani…	0
126	CRUZ	I understand that the Commissioner who works for Bill de Blasio has a political imperative.	0
127	CRUZ	de Blasio is a left-wing radical.	0
128	COOPER	The commander who oversaw the very program that you claim was as success in New York testified under oath that it didn’t lead to any investigations in the six years.	0
129	CRUZ	Anderson, in New York, this was a successful program….	0
130	COOPER	…  In what way?	0
131	CRUZ	It was set up under Mayor Michael Bloomberg to monitor and to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization, and to stop radical Islamic terrorism plots before it occurs…	0
132	COOPER	…  Can you name one case…	0
133	CRUZ	There are a number of cases.	0
134	CRUZ	It identified a bookstore that was a locus for radicalization and allowed law enforcement to after that bookstore, and what happened was when Mayor Bill de Blasio got elected he gave in to political correctness and shut the unit down.	0
135	CRUZ	Listen, if you want to stop radical Islamic terrorism, the answer isn’t to go hang out in random neighborhoods.	0
136	CRUZ	It is instead to focus on communities where radicalization is a risk.	0
137	CRUZ	And, I’ll tell you what Europe has done.	0
138	CRUZ	Europe has followed the path that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to put us on.	0
139	CRUZ	That the tragedies, these terror attacks in Europe are a result of failed immigration policies where they’ve allowed vast numbers of Islamic terrorists to come into Europe, and they’re in communities that are isolated.	0
140	CRUZ	They’re called “No-Go” communities where the law enforcement doesn’t engage in those communities.	0
141	CRUZ	One in Brussels, Molenbeek, has been a particular incubator for radical Islamic terrorism.	0
142	CRUZ	Many of these terrorist plots trace back to Molenbeek.	0
143	CRUZ	My plan is very simple, America should not make the mistakes of Europe.	0
144	CRUZ	We should not disengage.	0
145	CRUZ	We should have law enforcement actively engage to stop radicalization before it stops — and, I recognize that the media and the Democrats hate it when someone actually describes who the enemy is.	0
146	CRUZ	I’ll tell ya’, as President, every single day I will wake up fighting radical Islamic terrorism and working to defeat it.	0
147	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
148	COOPER	Turning back to the campaign.	0
149	COOPER	It’s obviously been a very rough and tumble week between you and Donald Trump.	0
150	COOPER	A salacious story about you was published in “National Enquirer”.	0
151	COOPER	You say Donald Trump, the people around him, were responsible for planting that story.	0
152	COOPER	Do you have any proof of that?	0
153	CRUZ	Sure.	0
154	CRUZ	There’s the story, on its face, quoted on the record, Roger Stone.	0
155	COOPER	Former advisor to…	0
156	CRUZ	…  Roger Stone has been Donald Trump’s Chief Political adviser.	0
157	CRUZ	He planned and ran his presidential campaign, and he’s been his hatchet man.	0
158	CRUZ	He spent 40 years as a hatchet man.	0
159	CRUZ	But, not only that, the head of the “National Enquirer”, a guy named David Pecker, is good friends with Donald Trump.	0
160	COOPER	But you don’t know it for a fact that Donald Trump planted that story?	0
161	CRUZ	Of course I do.	0
162	CRUZ	When his good friend — you know, the “National Enquirer”, in its history, has never endorsed a presidential candidate until Donald Trump?	0
163	CRUZ	And, now, David Pecker — look, Donald Trump suggested David Pecker, the head of the “National Enquirer”, should take over “Time” Magazine.	0
164	CRUZ	Who in their right mind should suggest the head of the “National Enquirer” should take over “Time” magazine?	0
165	COOPER	You’ve been very tough recently, but early on the campaign it seemed like you made a political calculation not to go after him.	0
166	COOPER	Just last week on a radio program, you said that essentially those candidates who did go after him early on were road kill, you needed to build your base.	0
167	COOPER	Back in December you tweeted, “The establishment’s only hope, Trump and me in a cage match, sorry to disappoint, Donald Trump is terrific.”	0
168	COOPER	That was after he’d already made fun of Carly Fiorina’s face, after he’d gone after Megyn Kelly.	0
169	COOPER	At that point in December, did you really believe Donald Trump was terrific?	0
170	CRUZ	Look, what I knew was that the media was engaged in a love fest.	0
171	CRUZ	Giving Donald Trump $2 billion dollars in premium (ph)…	0
172	COOPER	…  Sounds like you were engaged in a love fest.	0
173	CRUZ	Let’s be clear, how many hours of free media do CNN, and FOX, and every other station — you let him call in, and for a year — $2 billion dollars of free media…	1
174	COOPER	…  Well, I got to say, we’ve asked you for interviews pretty much every day, and you’ve declined every offer on my program…	0
175	CRUZ	… Well, Anderson….	0
176	COOPER	…  So, you can come on any time…	0
177	CRUZ	…  I want to point out I’ve been inviting Donald Trump for several days to come and make this a debate.	0
178	CRUZ	He’s coming later, and he’s terrified to make it a debate because he doesn’t want to actually stand and have his record challenged.	0
179	COOPER	But, when you called him terrific back in December, did you really believe that, or was that political calculation?	0
180	CRUZ	Let me make a point.	0
181	CRUZ	There has been a distinction that I have followed throughout, which is that I keep the focus on issues and substance, so I’m happy to draw distinction with Donald Trump on the issues, whether it is economic policy — that he doesn’t have a policy to bring jobs back to America, whether it is national security where is advocating for a far too weak foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable.	0
182	CRUZ	What I’m not interested in doing is what Donald’s pattern has been, which is the personal attacks.	0
183	CRUZ	It’s going to the gutter, it’s attacking family members.	0
184	CRUZ	None of that has any place in politics.	0
185	CRUZ	We ought to be discussing tax policy, we ought to be discussing national security.	0
186	CRUZ	We ought to be discussing substance…	0
187	COOPER	…  Let’s do that now…	0
188	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
189	CRUZ	…  Not engaging in mudslinging…	0
190	COOPER	… Let’s go to our first member of the audience.	0
191	COOPER	This is Thomas Dougherty (ph).	0
192	COOPER	He’s a student from Brookfield (ph) who says he’s still making up his mind.	0
193	COOPER	So you could pick up a vote here.	0
194	COOPER	Thomas, welcome.	0
195	CRUZ	Great.	0
196	CRUZ	Hey, Thomas.	0
197	QUESTION	Hi, Senator Cruz.	0
198	QUESTION	My question for you is, how and why does your religion play a part in your political decision-making?	0
199	QUESTION	Don’t you think it should be more of a moral belief and not something that can interfere with your decision-making when you’re making decisions for all religions in the United States?	0
200	CRUZ	Well, Thomas, thank you for that question.	0
201	CRUZ	Listen, with Me, as with many people in America, my faith is an integral part of who I am.	0
202	CRUZ	I’m a Christian, and I’m not embarrassed to say that.	0
203	CRUZ	I’m not going to hide that and treat it like it’s something you can’t admit publicly and acknowledge.	0
204	CRUZ	It’s an important part of who you are.	0
205	CRUZ	But I also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve.	0
206	CRUZ	There have been far too many politicians that run around behaving like they’re holier than thou.	0
207	CRUZ	And I’ll tell you, my attitude as a voter when some politician stands up and says, I’m running because God told me to vote — to run, my reaction as a voter is, great, when God tells me to vote for you, we’ll be on the same page.	0
208	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
209	CRUZ	And so, listen, I’m not asking you to vote for me because of my personal faith with Jesus Christ.	0
210	CRUZ	I’m asking you to vote for me because I’ve spent a lifetime fighting to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, fighting to defend the American free enterprise system, and we need a leader who will stand up every day and protect the rights of everyone, whether they’re Christians  or Jews or Muslims or anyone else.	0
211	CRUZ	The bill of rights protects all Americans.	0
212	CRUZ	It protects atheists.	0
213	CRUZ	That’s the beauty of the bill of rights, is that we have the freedom to seek out god, to worship and to live according to our faith and our conscience, and I think the Constitution and Bill of Rights is a unifying principle that can bring us together across faiths, across races, across ethnicity.	0
214	CRUZ	And we need to come together behind the unifying principles that built America.	0
215	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
216	COOPER	Thank you for your question.	0
217	COOPER	I want you to meet — this is Tim Matson (ph).	0
218	COOPER	His son, Jordan, traveled to Jordan in 2014, fought alongside Kurdish forces that were taking on ISIS.	0
219	COOPER	Tim says he is undecided.	0
220	COOPER	Tim, welcome.	0
221	QUESTION	Senator, when Jordan left for Syria, I was furious with him.	0
222	QUESTION	I couldn’t understand how he could do this.	0
223	QUESTION	But then I followed his steps on the internet, and I saw the mass murders and beheadings, sometimes of young children, and I understood.	0
224	QUESTION	Now I know we can’t be police of the world, but there’s lines that have been crossed that no civilized nation should ignore.	0
225	QUESTION	And we have a nation that’s often said, never again, but there again, here we are.	0
226	QUESTION	So as commander in chief, will you send an overwhelming force with unrestricted use of power to obliterate ISIS and send a message to those who want to do evil upon the innocents of their fate (ph) if they do this?	0
227	CRUZ	Well, Tim, thank you for that question.	0
228	CRUZ	And thank you for your son, Jordan, serving, and thank you for his sacrifice.	0
229	CRUZ	You know, the question of when to commit U.S. armed forces to combat is the most serious decision any president can make.	0
230	CRUZ	And I believe the decision to use military force should be keyed to the vital national security interest of this country.	0
231	CRUZ	Far too often we’ve seen in the last seven years where President Obama has not focused on our national security interests.	0
232	CRUZ	So, for example, we saw in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi, the dictator there, was a bad man.	0
233	CRUZ	He had a horrible human rights record.	0
234	CRUZ	He had been a state sponsor of terrorists.	0
235	CRUZ	But Gadhafi in his latter years had actually shaped up his conduct pretty dramatically in response to U.S. strength and had become an active participant working with America stopping radical Islamic terrorists — tracking them down, apprehending them, handing them over to us.	0
236	CRUZ	And what President Obama and Hillary Clinton did is they ended up joining with and leading many world forces in toppling Gadhafi, ultimately killing Gadhafi.	0
237	CRUZ	And the consequence in Libya is that country was handed over to radical Islamic terrorists.	0
238	CRUZ	It’s become a war zone of battling war lords.	0
239	CRUZ	And…	0
240	COOPER	The question is about U.S. troops, though, U.S. forces on the ground to defeat ISIS.	0
241	CRUZ	I understand.	0
242	CRUZ	And I’m answering the question, Anderson.	0
243	CRUZ	Thank you.	0
244	CRUZ	That was an enormous mistake.	0
245	CRUZ	And the reason they made the mistake is they weren’t focused on U.S. national security interests.	0
246	CRUZ	They were in the interests of promoting democracy, and toppling a government that ends up handing it over to radical Islamic terrorists is a much worse outcome.	0
247	CRUZ	We saw a similar thing in Egypt, where Obama and Hillary both cheered the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, the head of Egypt.	0
248	CRUZ	Egypt was handed over to the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi.	0
249	CRUZ	The Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization.	0
250	CRUZ	That was profoundly harmful for U.S. national security interests.	0
251	CRUZ	Thankfully president el-Sisi is now in charge of Egypt.	0
252	CRUZ	Now with regard to Syria, Assad is a monster.	0
253	CRUZ	I agree with you.	0
254	CRUZ	He’s a horrible man.	0
255	CRUZ	He has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens.	0
256	CRUZ	He has murdered women.	0
257	CRUZ	He has murdered children.	0
258	CRUZ	He has used chemical weapons against them.	0
259	CRUZ	But the problem is, if we simply topple Assad, the most likely outcome is that ISIS takes over Syria.	0
260	CRUZ	And handing Syria over to ISIS, to radical Islamic terrorists who are waging war with us is a mistake.	0
261	CRUZ	So your question of what we should do, our focus, I believe, in Syria should not be on toppling Assad.	0
262	CRUZ	Our focus should be on utterly and completely destroying ISIS, because ISIS is our enemy and ISIS has declared war on America and they pose a direct threat to our national security interests.	0
263	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
264	COOPER	In order to topple ISIS, would you be — I mean, his question is sending an overwhelming ground force.	0
265	COOPER	Would you be willing to send U.S. troops on the ground?	0
266	COOPER	Not just Special Forces as is currently being done.	0
267	CRUZ	Look, I will do whatever is necessary militarily to defeat ISIS.	0
268	CRUZ	Now, defeating ISIS is going to have a lot of components.	0
269	CRUZ	One of the most important components is overwhelming air power.	0
270	COOPER	You’ve talked about carpet bombing and just recently you said “carpet bomb them into oblivion.” Lieutenant General Charles Brown Jr., who is the commander of U.S. Air Forces, Central Command,  said carpet bombing is not effective for the operation that we’re actually executing because we’re using precision-guided munitions on a regular basis and, in fact, carpet bombing civilian areas is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.	0
271	CRUZ	Nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas.	0
272	CRUZ	What I have suggested we should do is use overwhelming air power.	0
273	CRUZ	And let me — let’s talk some specifics and some facts.	0
274	COOPER	What does carpet bombing mean?	0
275	CRUZ	I’m trying to answer your question, Anderson.	0
276	COOPER	OK.  Just for a fact, ISIS is in many civilian areas.	0
277	CRUZ	Let’s talk specific facts.	0
278	CRUZ	The first Persian Gulf War, a little over 25 years ago, we were launching roughly 1,100 air attacks a day.	0
279	CRUZ	We were using overwhelming airpower.	0
280	CRUZ	It’s one of the great strengths of the tremendous American military is our air superiority is second to none.	0
281	CRUZ	Right now, today, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.	0
282	COOPER	Right, but…	0
283	CRUZ	Compare the — but hold on, let me make my point, please, sir.	0
284	CRUZ	If you compare those two numbers, 1,100 air attacks a day, we did that for 37 days, and then our troops went in and in a day-and-a-half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.	0
285	CRUZ	Eleven hundred air attacks a day does crushing debilitating damage.	0
286	CRUZ	Fifteen to 30 a day is photo-op foreign policy.	0
287	COOPER	But I’ve talked to commanders who actually did the air campaign who said, look, it’s easy when you’re trying to take out — not easy, but it’s one thing when you are trying take out a government’s military, you can bomb their military-industrial complex, you can bomb factories, you can bomb their centers of command and control, you can bomb barracks.	0
288	COOPER	ISIS is a completely different kind of enemy.	0
289	CRUZ	But you can use all of those tools.	0
290	CRUZ	So you can take out their command and control headquarters.	0
291	CRUZ	You can take out their communication.	0
292	CRUZ	You can take out their means of transportation, ingress and egress.	0
293	CRUZ	You can take out their oil fields.	0
294	CRUZ	You can take out their oil refining capacity.	0
295	CRUZ	You can take out their infrastructure.	0
296	CRUZ	You can target their troops and their troop movements.	0
297	CRUZ	And we’re not doing that right now.	0
298	CRUZ	Overwhelming airpower is the first step, now it’s not the only step, but overwhelming airpower is the first step.	0
299	CRUZ	The next step is arming the Kurds.	0
300	CRUZ	The Kurds, the Peshmerga, fighting forces of the Kurds are very, very effective fighters.	0
301	CRUZ	They’re longtime allies of America.	0
302	CRUZ	They’re fighting ISIS right now.	0
303	CRUZ	ISIS is using U.S. military equipment that they seized in Iraq.	0
304	CRUZ	The Kurds are using outmoded equipment and the Obama administration refuses to arm them because of political reasons.	0
305	CRUZ	That doesn’t make sense.	0
306	CRUZ	We ought to be arming the Kurds and let them kill ISIS.	0
307	CRUZ	And then beyond that the question of Special Forces and ground troops.	0
308	CRUZ	We should do whatever is necessary to win, but I’ll tell you what I won’t do is I will not send our troops into combat the way Barack Obama is doing with rules of engagement so strict that they cannot fight, they cannot win, and they cannot defeat the enemy.	0
309	CRUZ	If we’re going to use our troops, we’re going to defeat the enemy.	0
310	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
311	COOPER	I want to go to our next questioner.	0
312	COOPER	This is Shannon O’Connell.	0
313	COOPER	She works in health care.	0
314	COOPER	She’s an independent voter.	0
315	COOPER	She says she is still undecided.	0
316	COOPER	Shannon, welcome.	0
317	CRUZ	Hi, Shannon.	0
318	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
319	QUESTION	My question is more personal in nature.	0
320	QUESTION	What would you regard as your greatest personal failure and what did you learn from it?	0
321	CRUZ	You know, those are always — whether in political campaign or a job interview, those are always tricky questions.	0
322	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
323	CRUZ	You know, any time you go for a job interview, you sit down and you’re like, OK, what’s your greatest weakness?	0
324	CRUZ	And, like, the classic answer people give at a job interview, you know, my greatest weakness is I just work too hard.	0
325	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
326	CRUZ	I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.	0
327	CRUZ	Look, there are pros and cons to it.	0
328	CRUZ	What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.	0
329	CRUZ	That has pros and cons.	0
330	CRUZ	I have always been a very driven guy.	0
331	CRUZ	… I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.	0
332	CRUZ	Look, there are pros and cons to it.	0
333	CRUZ	What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.	0
334	CRUZ	That has pros and cons.	0
335	CRUZ	I have always been a very driven guy.	0
336	CRUZ	I believe passionately in free-market principles and the Constitution.	0
337	CRUZ	My whole life — I mean, when I was a teenager, I studied and memorized a shortened mnemonic (ph) version of the Constitution and traveled around as part of a non-profit organization in Houston speaking about the Constitution, speaking about free-market principles.	0
338	CRUZ	And, you know, a lot of that, I think the reason that I’m so driven on this front has to do with my family background.	0
339	CRUZ	My father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, and when my dad came to America, he had nothing, and it really is — it’s an amazing thing when you grow up in the house with someone who’s fled oppression, because I remember when I was a little kid, we’d be watching TV, and there was an urgency to politics.	0
340	CRUZ	It wasn’t, oh, that’s interesting, a couple of candidates.	0
341	CRUZ	It was, having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny.	0
342	CRUZ	Now, I’ll confess, growing up in a Cuban-American household, you’re raised where there are two families — there are two parties.	0
343	CRUZ	The Republicans and the Communists.	0
344	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
345	CRUZ	And anyone who is Cuban-American will understand I’m not kidding really with that.	0
346	CRUZ	Now, I was really saddened to see Barack Obama go and pal around with the Castros and pose under a Che Guevera picture.	0
347	CRUZ	I mean, it drove that point home.	0
348	CRUZ	But as a kid, that gives you an urgency.	0
349	CRUZ	And so at times, listen, I’m hard charging.	0
350	CRUZ	That means I’ve stepped on some toes.	0
351	CRUZ	That means I’ve been focused very hard on fighting those fights, and maybe I should have pulled back in some circumstances.	0
352	CRUZ	So it is a strength and a weakness.	0
353	CRUZ	But I will say this, I am someone who what you see is what you get.	0
354	CRUZ	You know what I’m going to do in office.	0
355	CRUZ	It’s what I’ve done every day.	0
356	CRUZ	It’s what I believe.	0
357	CRUZ	It’s what I’ve spent my life fighting for.	0
358	CRUZ	And I think we’re at a time where we need a president who we know what he will do, and we know we can trust them to follow through on what they’re saying.	0
359	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
360	COOPER	Thank you for your question.	0

365	COOPER	William?	0

367	CRUZ	Follow your instincts, William.	0
368	QUESTION	Yes, right.	0
369	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
370	QUESTION	My students will often ask me, you know, they’ll say, have you seen or heard what the candidates are saying?	0
371	QUESTION	And oftentimes it’s not about substance.	0
372	QUESTION	It’s about, you know, what name we’ve been calling each other.	0
373	QUESTION	So I guess my question is, is it a good example to set for our youth of America, and should we stay on substance instead of calls each other names?	0
374	CRUZ	Yes.	0
375	CRUZ	Well, William, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you for the difference you make teaching kids and teaching in middle school.	0
376	CRUZ	I mean, middle school is obviously just a really pivotal age.	0
377	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
378	CRUZ	And I worry about that question, what lesson to our kids take watching this?	0
379	CRUZ	You know, Heidi and I, our girls are 5 and 7.	0
380	CRUZ	And they’re watching presidential candidates insulting each other, yelling, cursing, attacking family members.	0
381	CRUZ	I mean, it’s gotten really ugly, and just when you don’t think it can get any uglier, it gets uglier.	0
382	CRUZ	I think that has no place in politics, and my view — I have no ability to control what another candidate does.	0
383	CRUZ	But what I can control is my approach.	0
384	CRUZ	I’ll tell you the promise that I made to the people who joined our campaign from the beginning, the supporters who were with us from the beginning.	0
385	CRUZ	I said, listen, I can’t promise we’re going to win, I think we will, but I can promise you two things.	0
386	CRUZ	One, we’re going to work every day with a joyful spirit, we’re going to work every day and put everything weave into this campaign., and number two, we’re going to do so with integrity.	0
387	CRUZ	We’re not going to go into the gutter.	0
388	CRUZ	We’re not going to attack people personally.	0
389	CRUZ	We’re not going to malign their character.	0
390	CRUZ	We’re going to focus on issues and substance.	0
391	CRUZ	Now in the course of the campaign, there have been a bunch of candidates engaging in personal insults.	0
392	CRUZ	I’ve worked very, very hard to stay out of that and say, I’m not going into the gutter.	0
393	CRUZ	If you attack me personally, I’m not going to respond in kind.	0
394	CRUZ	Now, if you want to talk about your tax plan, I’ll compare my tax plan to your tax plan.	0
395	CRUZ	That should be the bread and butter of politics.	0
396	CRUZ	And it is my hope that at the end of the day that that is the approach that prevails.	0
397	CRUZ	I think it’s what the people of Wisconsin want.	0
398	CRUZ	I think it’s what the people of America want.	0
399	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
400	COOPER	Over here we have Jason Vorpel (ph).	0
401	COOPER	He’s a dairy farmer from Random Lake, Wisconsin.	0
402	COOPER	He says he’s voting for you, Senator Cruz — Jason.	0
403	CRUZ	Thank you, Jason.	0
404	QUESTION	I am a dairy farmer here in Wisconsin, and dairy farming in my family goes back to the 1800s when my great-great grandparents starting farming with six cows.	0
405	QUESTION	Today we have 2,800 cows.	0
406	CRUZ	Wow.	0
407	QUESTION	And it’s a 24-hour operation.	0
408	QUESTION	We offer a competitive wage and offer full benefits to all our employees.	0
409	QUESTION	Most farms in the dairy industry cannot find American-born workers to milk the cows and take care of them.	0
410	QUESTION	The only ones willing to do this hard work are Latino immigrants who, if we didn’t have them for eight hours, there would be a crisis across the country in our industry.	0
411	QUESTION	What is the short-term solution to keep our current labor force intact?	0
412	QUESTION	And what is the long-term solution moving forward?	0
413	CRUZ	Right.	0
414	CRUZ	Well, thank you for sharing your experience as a dairy farmer, and, you know, there are farmers across this country who are really hurting.	0
415	CRUZ	And farmers are hurting from a lot of things.	0
416	CRUZ	They’re hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive.	0
417	CRUZ	They’re hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms.	0
418	CRUZ	For example, the Waters of the United States Rule where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations.	0
419	CRUZ	And I think we need a president, we need an administration that takes the burdens off farmers so that it is easier to do your job which is incredibly important.	0
420	CRUZ	Now, when it comes to labor, I understand the need to have labor and that it can be hard to have agricultural labor.	0
421	CRUZ	You know, I’ll tell you, though, one of the consequences of our immigration system right now, when we’ve got 12 million people who are here illegally, that has an effect of driving down wages for Americans across this country.	0
422	CRUZ	There was a very interesting article, it was about, oh, a month, maybe six weeks ago in The Wall Street Journal, it was focusing on Arizona.	0
423	CRUZ	You’ll recall several years ago Arizona put in place really tough laws on illegal immigration.	0
424	CRUZ	And they were criticized loudly for putting those laws in place.	0
425	CRUZ	And it was interesting, this Wall Street Journal article, because it talked about what happened in the wake of that law, which is a great many of the illegal immigrants left.	0
426	CRUZ	They left the state and went elsewhere.	0
427	CRUZ	And it actually quoted a farmer, and that’s the reason I’m bringing up this example, it quoted a farmer, a fellow in Arizona who was growing peppers.	0
428	CRUZ	And he complained, he said, listen, all people that we had picking peppers, they left.	0
429	CRUZ	And he said, I didn’t know what to do.	0
430	CRUZ	I didn’t  know that we were going to be able to pick our peppers.	0
431	CRUZ	And what it described that he did is he actually went and invented a new tool to help pick the peppers.	0
432	CRUZ	And then he went down to the local community college and he ended up hiring Americans coming out of the community college.	0
433	CRUZ	He had to pay them more.	0
434	CRUZ	He paid them about $15 an hour.	0
435	CRUZ	But he continues picking his peppers except he’s doing so in a situation where what has happened in Arizona, the public expenditures have plummeted.	0
436	CRUZ	Arizona is spending hundreds of millions of dollars less on prisons, on education, on hospitals, for those here illegally.	0
437	CRUZ	That means that’s hundreds of millions of dollars available to take care of U.S. citizens.	0
438	CRUZ	And also unemployment has gone down and median wages for Americans have gone up in the construction industry, carpenters.	0
439	CRUZ	We’re seeing wages going up.	0
440	CRUZ	And I think the view — our immigration laws should benefit American workers.	0
441	CRUZ	That should be the focus of immigration laws.	0
442	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
443	CRUZ	And so what I intend to do as president is, number one, we’re going to secure the border.	0
444	CRUZ	We’re going to end illegal immigration.	0
445	CRUZ	We know how to do it.	0
446	CRUZ	And what’s missing is the political will to get it done.	0
447	CRUZ	The difference is I will get it done.	0
448	CRUZ	But beyond that, when it comes to legal immigration, listen, I think on immigration the principles are really simple.	0
449	CRUZ	Legal, good.	0
450	CRUZ	Illegal, bad.	0
451	CRUZ	It’s amazing how many — how many folks in politics, how many folks in the media have trouble understanding that.	0
452	CRUZ	I’m reminded, you guys remember former Congressman Sonny Bono from “Sonny & Cher”?	0
453	CRUZ	Years ago Sonny Bono was asked, what’s your view on illegal immigration?	0
454	CRUZ	He said, well, it’s illegal, isn’t it?	0
455	CRUZ	We’re going to solve this problem by securing the border and ending illegal immigration.	0
456	CRUZ	And once we do that, that’s going to drive up wages for Americans across this country.	0
457	CRUZ	And in the agriculture world, I think the first option should be trying to find American workers.	0
458	CRUZ	Now that may mean wages come up.	0
459	CRUZ	It may mean that we have to use more tools.	0
460	CRUZ	We’ve seen in Arizona that has happened.	0
461	CRUZ	And beyond that, our legal immigration system, if there are needs in the labor force and American workers not available to do it, that’s where legal immigration should come in.	0
462	CRUZ	But it should be in a situation where you’re vetting the people rather than just having people come in that we don’t know who they are, and we don’t know their criminal history, we don’t know their background.	0
463	CRUZ	It should be through the legal system targeted in a way that protects American workers.	0

474	COOPER	John Kasich, Donald Trump coming up.	0
475	COOPER	But more voter questions now for Senator Cruz.	0
476	COOPER	I want to start, though — more than six months ago, you pledged to support the Republican nominee.	0
477	COOPER	When things started getting rough with Donald Trump, you said you were going to stick with that pledge because you’d given your word.	0
478	COOPER	I saw in an interview with my colleague, Sunlen Serfaty – I think it was just yesterday.	0
479	COOPER	You’re said you’re not in a habit of supporting people who attack your wife and attack your family.	0
480	COOPER	Do you still stand by the pledge to support whoever the nominee, even if it’s Donald Trump?	0
481	CRUZ	Well, Anderson, as you mentioned, what I said is true.	0
482	CRUZ	I’m not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family.	0
483	CRUZ	I think that is going beyond the line.	0
484	CRUZ	I think our wives, I think our kids should be off limits.	0
485	CRUZ	They don’t belong in the attacks.	0
486	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
487	CRUZ	And, listen, I’m not an easy person to tick off, but when you go after my wife, when you go after my daughters, that does it.	0
488	CRUZ	And I think — I want this race to stay focused on policy and issues and solutions to the real problems facing America.	0
489	CRUZ	That’s where I’m going to stay focused.	0
490	CRUZ	But if other candidates don’t, I think that’s beyond the pale.	0
491	COOPER	So I just have to follow-up, if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, would you support him?	0
492	CRUZ	Let me tell you my solution to that.	0
493	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
494	CRUZ	Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee.	0
495	CRUZ	We’re going to beat him.	0
496	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
497	COOPER	I would be remiss if I didn’t follow-up.	0
498	COOPER	That’s my greatest failing.	0
499	COOPER	That was the question earlier for you.	0
500	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
501	COOPER	My greatest failing is sometimes I don’t follow up, so not to give into that, I mean, I got to ask, I will assume by you saying  you would not support him, that the answer is you would not support him if he is the nominee?	0
502	CRUZ	I gave you my answer.	0
503	CRUZ	Listen, I think nominating Donald Trump would be an absolute train wreck.	0
504	CRUZ	I think it would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.	0
505	CRUZ	Poll after poll after poll shows Donald Trump losing 10, 11, 12 points or more.	0
506	CRUZ	I don’t want to see the White House given over to Hillary Clinton.	0
507	CRUZ	I don’t want to see us lose the Senate and House, lose the Supreme Court for a generation, lose the Bill of Rights.	0
508	CRUZ	I think nominating Donald Trump is a disaster, and so the answer to that is not to scream and yell and cry and attack him, the answer to that is to beat him at the ballot box.	0
509	CRUZ	That’s what we’re working every day to do.	0
510	CRUZ	It’s what we’re campaigning every day here in Wisconsin to do.	0
511	COOPER	This is Benjamin Miller.	0
512	COOPER	He’s a student at University of Wisconsin.	0
513	COOPER	He says he’s also voting for you next week.	0
514	COOPER	Benjamin, welcome.	0
515	QUESTION	Good evening, senator.	0
516	CRUZ	Benjamin, welcome.	0
517	QUESTION	Both Paris and now Brussels have suffered blindside attacks by Islamic terrorists.	0
518	QUESTION	Although I fear a terrorist attack on the United States, I have a greater fear of the government taking away my constitutional freedoms and privacy in the name of security.	0
519	CRUZ	Yes.	0
520	QUESTION	As president, how will you ensure that America is not blindly attacked, while also maintaining the privacy of the American people?	0
521	CRUZ	Well, Benjamin, thank you for that question, and it’s a very important question.	0
522	CRUZ	You know, there are some in politics who say it’s an either/or choice.	0
523	CRUZ	We can either protect America or protect our civil liberties.	0
524	CRUZ	I don’t accept that choice.	0
525	CRUZ	I think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
526	CRUZ	I think it is possible — and the difference — something the Obama administration is not very good at — they’re not very good at distinguishing between bad guys and good guys.	0
527	CRUZ	So over and over again, the Obama administration’s solution, for example, when it comes to surveillance, was to monitor the phone calls or the e-mails of millions of law-abiding citizens, but because of their political correctness, because they won’t focus on and identify radical Islamic terrorists, they don’t actually target the bad guys.	0
528	CRUZ	It’s why it’s so important — and you know, it’s interesting, Benjamin, people in the media, sometimes they ask, why does it matter whether Obama will say the words “radical Islamic terrorism?”  It matters because if you don’t identify the problem, you don’t devote — you don’t direct law enforcement and national security resources to stopping it.	0
529	CRUZ	I’ll give a specific example.	0
530	CRUZ	My home state of Florida, Fort Hood, Nidal Hassan committed a horrific terrorist attack there.	0
531	CRUZ	Now, the  Obama administration knew before the attack that Nidal Hassan communicated with Anwar Al Awlaki, a known radical Islamic cleric.	0
532	CRUZ	They knew that Nidal Hassan had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad and murdering his fellow soldiers.	0
533	CRUZ	And yet for whatever reason, political correctness or what have you, they didn’t do anything.	0
534	CRUZ	If we find out that a member of the Armed Services is talking with a radical Islamic cleric and asking about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers, within minutes, MPs should show up at his door and put him in handcuffs.	0
535	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
536	CRUZ	But they didn’t do that, and Nidal Hassan murdered 14 innocent souls, including an unborn child, yelling “allahu akbar.”  And then the Obama administration in truly a stunning display of political correctness defined that terrorist attack as workplace violence.	0
537	CRUZ	We need to direct our resources at going after the Nidal Hassans, going after the radical Islamic terrorists, and we can do that at the same time as not infringing the privacy of law-abiding Americans, distinguishing between the bad guys and the good guys.	0
538	CRUZ	That’s what this administration hadn’t been doing.	0
539	COOPER	Thank you for your question.	0
540	COOPER	This is Victoria Ostry (ph), a small business owner from Brookefield (ph).	0
541	COOPER	She says she is also voting for you next week.	0
542	COOPER	Victoria?	0
543	QUESTION	Hi, Senator Cruz.	0
544	CRUZ	Hi, Victoria.	0
545	QUESTION	Women are more than 50 percent of the voting electorate.	0
546	QUESTION	What have you done, and what are you going to do to convince and persuade women to vote for you?	0
547	CRUZ	Well, Victoria, thank you for that question, and you’re absolutely right.	0
548	CRUZ	You know, I will say one of the things I’ve really been blessed in my life is that I have a grown up surrounded by strong women.	0
549	CRUZ	My mom is someone who I admire immensely.	0
550	CRUZ	My mom is Irish-Italian.	0
551	CRUZ	She grew up Wilmington, Delaware.	0
552	CRUZ	She grew up in a working-class family.	0
553	CRUZ	Her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids.	0
554	CRUZ	And, my mom became the first person in her family ever to go to college.	0
555	CRUZ	And, that was not easy for her because my grandfather, her dad, he was not an easy man.	0
556	CRUZ	He was a drunk, and he didn’t think women should be educated.	0
557	CRUZ	And, so my mom stood up to her father.	0
558	CRUZ	She stood up to him, confronted him and she ended up going Rice.	0
559	CRUZ	She majored in math in 1956., and then she got hired at Shell as a computer programmer.	0
560	CRUZ	Now, you want to talk about two industries, computer science and oil and gas, neither one of which were welcoming to women, and my mom was at the intersection of them both.	0
561	CRUZ	And, I remember my mom used to tell me a lot when I was a kid, she said, she very deliberately didn’t learn how to type.	0
562	CRUZ	She said, look, it was the 1950s.	0
563	CRUZ	I understood the world I was living.	0
564	CRUZ	She didn’t want to be walking down the hall and have some man stop her and say, Sweetheart, would you type this for me?	0
565	CRUZ	She wanted to be able to respond with a clean conscience and smile and say, I would love to help you out, but I don’t know how to type.	0

567	CRUZ	I guess you’re going to have to use me as a computer programmer instead.	0
568	CRUZ	And, whether it’s my mom, who as a pioneer computer programmer — she’s 81 now, she’s been a best friend to me my whole life.	0
569	CRUZ	She’s an amazing grandmother to our two little girls.	0
570	CRUZ	Whether it’s my wife, Heidi, who is the daughter of Christian Missionaries, she lived in Africa as a kid several times.	0
571	CRUZ	She’s someone who has been an incredible businesswoman.	0
572	CRUZ	She’s strong.	0
573	CRUZ	Listen, when you’re married to a strong woman professional, you see the nonsense that women deal with in the business environment.	0
574	CRUZ	You see the garbage they put up with.	0
575	CRUZ	And, it makes you mad.	0
576	CRUZ	I’ve been blessed my whole life to be surrounded by strong women.	0
577	CRUZ	I think women right now are particularly concerned about the direction of this country, are particularly concerned our kids are going to have, what kind of country we’re giving to the next generation.	0
578	CRUZ	I think women quite rightly are very concerned about safety and security, and a president that’s protecting us from terrorists.	0
579	CRUZ	And, I believe what protects women — you know, the Democrats love to put everyone in a little pigeon hole, and so this is a woman’s issue, this is a Hispanic issue, this is an African-American issue.	0
580	CRUZ	Listen, I believe every issue is a woman’s issue, and the focus of my campaign is on three things.	0
581	CRUZ	It’s on jobs, freedom, and security.	0
582	CRUZ	Bringing back the opportunity, raising wages, bringing jobs back to America, I think that is resonating powerfully with women, and fighting to protect the Bill of Rights, and equal opportunity for women and men, and everyone.	0
583	CRUZ	And, I’ll tell you there’s no one I fight harder for than our two little girls, Caroline and Catherine who are the loves of my life, and who can do anything.	0
584	CRUZ	And, I want to make sure they have a world they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything.	0
585	COOPER	Senator, thank you very much.	0
586	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
587	COOPER	I’m going to try and get time for two more questions.	0
588	COOPER	I want you to meet Marv Simcakoski, he’s from Stevens Point, he says at this point he’s undecided.	0
589	COOPER	Marv, welcome.	0
590	QUESTION	Thank you both.	0
591	QUESTION	My son, Jason, was a former Marine who was killed by over-prescription of medication while he was an in-patient at the V.A.	0
592	QUESTION	facility in Tomo, Wisconsin.	0
593	QUESTION	Every day you see stories and news about people all over Wisconsin, people from rural areas, big cities, and small towns who are addicted to opioids and heroin.	0
594	QUESTION	There is bipartisan legislation in front of congress right now named after my son which would, in part, require stronger opiate prescribing guidelines for V.A.	0
595	QUESTION	providers.	0
596	QUESTION	Will you support this bipartisan legislation, and do you support requiring stronger opiate prescribing guidelines, not only for the V.A., but for doctors across this country?	0
597	CRUZ	Well, Marv, thank you for sharing your story, and thank you for your son’s service and his sacrifice.	0
598	CRUZ	I’m sorry that you lost son, Jason.	0
599	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
600	CRUZ	And this is a tragedy we’re seeing across the country.	0
601	CRUZ	We’re seeing veterans coming back struggling with PTSD.	0
602	CRUZ	Struggling to get their health care needs treated, treated properly.	0
603	CRUZ	We’re seeing a V.A.	0
604	CRUZ	that is dysfunctional.	0
605	CRUZ	A V.A.	0
606	CRUZ	that is lying.	0
607	CRUZ	One of the things we need is we need real accountability in the V.A.	0
608	CRUZ	I give you my word, if I am president, there will be accountability in the V.A.	0
609	CRUZ	Those that have lied, those that have wrongfully denied care, they will be terminated.	0
610	CRUZ	And if they broke the law, they will be prosecuted.	0
611	CRUZ	We also need reform in the V.A.	0
612	CRUZ	so that veterans have the power to choose their own doctors.	0
613	CRUZ	Whether they want to choose the V.A.	0
614	CRUZ	or a private doctor, there’s no reason your son, Jason, couldn’t have gone to the doctor down the street.	0
615	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
616	CRUZ	Now, I agree with you, we need greater scrutiny, greater involvement preventing opioid abuse.	0
617	CRUZ	You look at the prevalence of heroin — and I would note this is a tragedy.	0
618	CRUZ	Roughly 50,000 people a year die of drug overdoses.	0
619	CRUZ	More people in America die of drug overdoses than die in car crashes.	0
620	CRUZ	And Marv, I’m sorry to say, you and I are both members of a horrible club because I lost my sister, Miriam, to a drug overdose.	0
621	CRUZ	And so I’ve seen first hand — and it actually started — it started when she was in a car accident, and she got prescribed painkillers.	0
622	CRUZ	And she kept on taking the painkillers, and then she started taking strong, and she started taking stronger.	0
623	CRUZ	And Miriam led a difficult and troubled life.	0
624	CRUZ	She made a lot of very poor decisions.	0
625	CRUZ	And then just a few years ago, she took too many pills one night, and her son came in and found her dead.	0
626	CRUZ	This is an epidemic that is destroying families across America.	0
627	CRUZ	I’ am sorry for your family’s loss.	0
628	CRUZ	I’m sorry.	0
629	CRUZ	My nephew, Joey, her son, someone I’m really proud of.	0
630	CRUZ	He’s endured his mom’s difficult journey, and he’s working a good job.	0
631	CRUZ	He’s a responsible — he’s a terrific young man.	0
632	CRUZ	But we need a federal government that focuses on stopping this drug abuse, whether it is prescription drug abuse or whether it is illegal narcotics like heroin.	0
633	CRUZ	And one of the most important ways to stop that — you know, unfortunately my sister, Miriam, ended up going down that path, going down the path of crack cocaine and drugs that destroyed her life.	0
634	CRUZ	One of the ways to prevent that is we need to secure the border.	0
635	CRUZ	We need to get serious about stopping the incredible flow from Mexican drug cartels that are poisoning our kids.	0
636	CRUZ	And you have my commitment as president — I’m not going to talk about it.	0
637	CRUZ	I’m not going to make empty promises.	0
638	CRUZ	But we are going to devote the full resources of the federal government to finally, finally, finally  secures the border, stopping illegal immigration, but stopping the deluge of drugs that is coming into this country and destroying the lives of people all across this country.	0

640	COOPER	This is Tim Omer.	0
641	COOPER	He says he is leaning in your favor.	0
642	COOPER	Tim, welcome.	0
643	CRUZ	Hey, Tim.	0
644	TIM OMER, WISCONSIN VOTER	Welcome to Wisconsin, Senator.	0
645	CRUZ	Thank you.	0
646	OMER	As a growing company, our biggest challenge is finding talented and qualified people to fill all the positions that we have open in our company.	0
647	OMER	As president of the United States, what could you do to help us find those talented people, find those quality people, build up the pool of people so that we can fill those positions and continue to grow our business?	0
648	CRUZ	Tim, tell me what kind of company do you have?	0
649	OMER	We’re Wisconsin cheese.	0
650	CRUZ	Wisconsin cheese, fabulous!	0
651	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
652	CRUZ	I will confess something.	0
653	CRUZ	And as my wife, Heidi, is my witness, my favorite food in all the world is cheese.	0
654	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
655	CRUZ	And I am not says that to pander in Wisconsin.	0
656	CRUZ	But if you wouldn’t point it out here, where would you point it out?	0
657	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
658	CRUZ	Listen, it is a huge problem we see of a need for a trained workforce and a need for a workforce that’s prepared and wants to work.	0
659	CRUZ	You know, as I meet with small business owners all across the country, I hear those concerns over and over and over again that it’s hard to get people who are qualified and who want to work and are prepared to work, and that’s a real challenge.	0
660	CRUZ	And, you know, the key to jobs and job creation is small businesses, is doing what you do.	0
661	CRUZ	How many employees do you guys have?	0
662	OMER	About 300.	0
663	CRUZ	About 300.	0
664	CRUZ	I mean, that’s where job creation comes from.	0
665	CRUZ	It comes from small businesses.	0
666	CRUZ	Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses.	0
667	CRUZ	Now, in terms of getting new and able workers, we need to do several things.	0
668	CRUZ	Number one, we need to reform education.	0
669	CRUZ	You know, the step to having well-trained workers is having a strong education program.	0
670	CRUZ	And if you look at education right now, number one, I think the federal government needs to get the heck out of it.	0
671	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
672	CRUZ	It’s one of the reasons I promised on the very first day in office that I’m going to direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.	0
673	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
674	CRUZ	And I think what we ought to be doing is abolishing the federal Department of Education and block-granting that money to send it back to Wisconsin.	0
675	CRUZ	I think the people of Wisconsin know much better what to do with that money.	0
676	CRUZ	And part of that money, I think, should be directed at school choice programs, and allowing people who are trapped in failing schools to have the option of going to private schools, going to parochial schools, injecting competition in failing schools to empower parents and empower students.	0
677	CRUZ	I think school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st Century.	0
678	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
679	CRUZ	And part of that money as well in Wisconsin ought to be directed to vocational training, ought to be directed to different nontraditional ways where people can earn skills, whether it’s distance learning, whether it is using the Internet, using options where your only option isn’t spending $50,000 a year at a four-year college but expanding the options for people to get education.	0
680	CRUZ	I think that is a critical piece to improving the environment.	0
681	CRUZ	And another critical piece is changing our welfare program.	0
682	CRUZ	You know, our welfare program right now traps people in dependency.	0
683	CRUZ	Now, my view on welfare is that the social safety net, it should be a trampoline and not a hammock.	0
684	CRUZ	That the whole purpose of the social safety net should be to get you back on your feet.	0
685	CRUZ	Everyone falls on hard times, but you’re not helping someone trapping them in dependence.	0
686	CRUZ	And I’ll tell you, I visited with a fellow who owns a cookie factory.	0
687	CRUZ	Tell you, between cookies and cheese, you really can have a great party right there.	0
688	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
689	CRUZ	But he owns a cookie factory.	0
690	CRUZ	And he talked to me about where in the 1990s when Congress passed welfare reform, when Congress put in place a strong work requirement for welfare, and you recall the liberals in the media were saying, you’re going to throw people out on the street, people are going to be starving, it’s going to be terrible.	0
691	CRUZ	It’s one of the most successful public policy reforms we’ve ever seen.	0
692	CRUZ	Millions of people left welfare and got jobs.	0
693	CRUZ	This fellow who owns the cookie factory described to me how suddenly they had people lining up to work.	0
694	CRUZ	Because they weren’t getting paid in perpetuity to stay at home and watch “Gilligan’s Island.” They had to go get a job.	0
695	CRUZ	And you know what, if you help someone get a job, ultimately that is giving them the dignity of work.	0
696	CRUZ	I believe every American wants to have that dignity to provide for their families.	0
697	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
698	COOPER	We’ve got to wrap it up.	0
699	COOPER	I want to thank Senator Cruz very much for being with us.	0
