1	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
2	Donald Trump	I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.	0
3	Donald Trump	He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.	0
4	Donald Trump	And he has had a tremendous career.	0
5	Donald Trump	He's a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.	0
6	Donald Trump	And so Alex, I've wished him the best.	0
7	Donald Trump	We just spoke.	0
8	Donald Trump	And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.	0
9	Donald Trump	And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget.	0
10	Donald Trump	And he will be I think a fantastic addition.	0
11	Donald Trump	Paul Singer just left.	0
12	Donald Trump	As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, "never Trump."	0
13	Donald Trump	And Paul just left and he's given us his total support.	0
14	Donald Trump	And it's all about unification.	0
15	Donald Trump	We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country.	0
16	Donald Trump	It's very important to me.	0
17	Donald Trump	I've been talking about that for a long time.	0
18	Donald Trump	It's very, very important to me.	0
19	Donald Trump	So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.	0
20	Donald Trump	He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.	0
21	Donald Trump	And I appreciate that.	0
22	Donald Trump	I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.	0
23	Donald Trump	And I had this time.	0
24	Donald Trump	We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.	0
25	Donald Trump	And we've done some really good work.	0
26	Donald Trump	We're very proud of that.	0
27	Donald Trump	And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions.	0
28	Donald Trump	That's always a possibility.	0
29	Donald Trump	I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.	0
30	Donald Trump	We have made incredible progress.	0
31	Donald Trump	I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.	0
32	Donald Trump	A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it.	0
33	Donald Trump	They actually get it, but they don't write it.	0
34	Donald Trump	Let's put it that way.	0
35	Donald Trump	But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.	0
36	Donald Trump	The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.	1
37	Donald Trump	And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.	1
38	Donald Trump	It used to mean, "Oh, that's good."	0
39	Donald Trump	Now it means, "That's good for jobs."	0
40	Donald Trump	Very different.	0
41	Donald Trump	Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.	0
42	Donald Trump	I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you.	0
43	Donald Trump	This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.	0
44	Donald Trump	And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible.	0
45	Donald Trump	Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.	0
46	Donald Trump	Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.	0
47	Donald Trump	The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.	0
48	Donald Trump	Tremendous disservice.	0
49	Donald Trump	We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.	0
50	Donald Trump	The level of dishonesty is out of control.	0
51	Donald Trump	I ran for president to present the citizens of our country.	0
52	Donald Trump	I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.	0
53	Donald Trump	I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment.	0
54	Donald Trump	As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say -- they're honest and fantastic.	0
55	Donald Trump	But much of it is not a -- the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it.	0
56	Donald Trump	But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people.	0
57	Donald Trump	As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.	0
58	Donald Trump	To be honest, I inherited a mess.	0
59	Donald Trump	It's a mess.	0
60	Donald Trump	At home and abroad, a mess.	0
61	Donald Trump	Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.	0
62	Donald Trump	The middle east is a disaster.	0
63	Donald Trump	North Korea -- we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all.	0
64	Donald Trump	I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.	0
65	Donald Trump	Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.	0
66	Donald Trump	On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.	0
67	Donald Trump	We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings.	0
68	Donald Trump	Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations.	0
69	Donald Trump	I would say far more productive than you would understand.	0
70	Donald Trump	We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs.	0
71	Donald Trump	It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.	0
72	Donald Trump	I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis.	0
73	Donald Trump	He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.	0
74	Donald Trump	It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.	0
75	Donald Trump	They've spread like cancer.	0
76	Donald Trump	ISIS has spread like cancer -- another mess I inherited.	0
77	Donald Trump	And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.	0
78	Donald Trump	And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.	0
79	Donald Trump	I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.	0
80	Donald Trump	Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.	0
81	Donald Trump	We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it.	0
82	Donald Trump	But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.	0
83	Donald Trump	We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old.	0
84	Donald Trump	I used it; I talked about it at every stop.	0
85	Donald Trump	Depleted, it's depleted -- it won't be depleted for long.	0
86	Donald Trump	And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.	0
87	Donald Trump	We have to have a strong law enforcement also.	0
88	Donald Trump	So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength.	0
89	Donald Trump	At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.	0
90	Donald Trump	In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people.	0
91	Donald Trump	These are campaign promises.	0
92	Donald Trump	Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.	0
93	Donald Trump	Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders.	0
94	Donald Trump	They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else.	0
95	Donald Trump	One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.	0
96	Donald Trump	They lied to the American people in order to get elected.	0
97	Donald Trump	Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.	0
98	Donald Trump	And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians.	0
99	Donald Trump	I'm here following through on what I pledged to do.	0
100	Donald Trump	That's all I'm doing.	0
101	Donald Trump	I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes.	0
102	Donald Trump	I wasn't supposed to get 222.	0
103	Donald Trump	They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.	0
104	Donald Trump	270 which you need, that was laughable.	0
105	Donald Trump	We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.	1
106	Donald Trump	I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.	1
107	Donald Trump	In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.	0
108	Donald Trump	And -- but a lot of people are happy about it.	0
109	Donald Trump	In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.	0
110	Donald Trump	I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos.	0
111	Donald Trump	Chaos.	0
112	Donald Trump	Yet it is the exact opposite.	0
113	Donald Trump	This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.	0
114	Donald Trump	And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate.	0
115	Donald Trump	He can't get approved.	0
116	Donald Trump	How do you not approve him?	0
117	Donald Trump	He's been a colleague -- highly respected.	0
118	Donald Trump	Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it.	0
119	Donald Trump	We're waiting for approval.	0
120	Donald Trump	So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.	0
121	Donald Trump	So, if the Democrats who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now.	0
122	Donald Trump	The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me.	0
123	Donald Trump	Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time.	0
124	Donald Trump	I just got here.	0
125	Donald Trump	And I got here with no cabinet.	0
126	Donald Trump	Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.	0
127	Donald Trump	I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks -- in the weeks coming.	0
128	Donald Trump	We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership.	0
129	Donald Trump	We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral.	0
130	Donald Trump	We're going to have one on one deals.	0
131	Donald Trump	We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.	0
132	Donald Trump	People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.	0
133	Donald Trump	They go in for a permit, it's many, many years.	0
134	Donald Trump	And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.	0
135	Donald Trump	Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection.	0
136	Donald Trump	Not going to take years.	0
137	Donald Trump	But mostly it's going to be an acceptance.	0
138	Donald Trump	We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs.	0
139	Donald Trump	We don't want the jobs going to other countries.	0
140	Donald Trump	We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers.	0
141	Donald Trump	We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.	0
142	Donald Trump	We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
143	Donald Trump	Makes sense.	0
144	Donald Trump	Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have.	0
145	Donald Trump	You go to other countries and you look at indexes they have and you say "let me see your regulations" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.	0
146	Donald Trump	And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental -- all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.	0
147	Donald Trump	It's very important to me.	0
148	Donald Trump	But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.	0
149	Donald Trump	We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.	0
150	Donald Trump	We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities.	0
151	Donald Trump	Horrible.	0
152	Donald Trump	We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.	0
153	Donald Trump	We're becoming a drug infested nation.	0
154	Donald Trump	Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.	0
155	Donald Trump	We are not going to let it happen any longer.	0
156	Donald Trump	We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe.	0
157	Donald Trump	And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process.	0
158	Donald Trump	And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me.	0
159	Donald Trump	The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government.	0
160	Donald Trump	And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.	0
161	Donald Trump	We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.	0
162	Donald Trump	No more release.	0
163	Donald Trump	No matter who you are, release.	0
164	Donald Trump	We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety.	0
165	Donald Trump	We are saving American lives every single day.	0
166	Donald Trump	The court system has not made it easy for us.	0
167	Donald Trump	And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many.	0
168	Donald Trump	We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
169	Donald Trump	No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling.	0
170	Donald Trump	Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe.	0
171	Donald Trump	And is vigorously defending this lawful order.	0
172	Donald Trump	I will not back down from defending our country.	0
173	Donald Trump	I got elected on defense of our country.	0
174	Donald Trump	I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.	0
175	Donald Trump	They already are, I can tell you that.	0
176	Donald Trump	Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.	0
177	Donald Trump	In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.	1
178	Donald Trump	I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.	1
179	Donald Trump	I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.	0
180	Donald Trump	But we are appealing that, and we are going further.	0
181	Donald Trump	We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country.	0
182	Donald Trump	So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people.	0
183	Donald Trump	That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.	0
184	Donald Trump	We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines.	0
185	Donald Trump	Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.	0
186	Donald Trump	In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel.	0
187	Donald Trump	And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.	0
188	Donald Trump	Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.	0
189	Donald Trump	And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel?	0
190	Donald Trump	And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in.	0
191	Donald Trump	To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.	0
192	Donald Trump	We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
193	Donald Trump	Obamacare is a disaster, folks.	0
194	Donald Trump	It is's disaster.	0
195	Donald Trump	I know you can say, oh, Obamacare.	0
196	Donald Trump	I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.	0
197	Donald Trump	So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country.	0
198	Donald Trump	Big league.	0
199	Donald Trump	It's already happening.	0
200	Donald Trump	But big league.	0
201	Donald Trump	I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.	0
202	Donald Trump	You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years.	0
203	Donald Trump	That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.	0
204	Donald Trump	You look at Rex Tillerson.	0
205	Donald Trump	He's out there negotiating right now.	0
206	Donald Trump	General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.	0
207	Donald Trump	We have great, great people.	0
208	Donald Trump	Mick is with us now.	0
209	Donald Trump	We have great people.	0
210	Donald Trump	Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.	0
211	Donald Trump	Now look, fair trade.	0
212	Donald Trump	Not free, fair.	0
213	Donald Trump	If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore.	0
214	Donald Trump	Every country takes advantage of us almost.	0
215	Donald Trump	I may be able to find a couple that don't.	0
216	Donald Trump	But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.	0
217	Donald Trump	Jobs have already started to surge.	0
218	Donald Trump	Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.	0
219	Donald Trump	Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.	0
220	Donald Trump	They were with me a week ago.	0
221	Donald Trump	You know you were here.	0
222	Donald Trump	General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.	0
223	Donald Trump	And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left.	0
224	Donald Trump	And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.	0
225	Donald Trump	Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.	0
226	Donald Trump	And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.	0
227	Donald Trump	Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.	0
228	Donald Trump	There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.	0
229	Donald Trump	Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks.	0
230	Donald Trump	And we're not going to let that happen anymore.	0
231	Donald Trump	Not going to let it happen.	0
232	Donald Trump	And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats.	0
233	Donald Trump	You may not see that.	0
234	Donald Trump	But he'll get there one way or the other.	0
235	Donald Trump	But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.	0
236	Donald Trump	This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.	0
237	Donald Trump	Again, I say it.	0
238	Donald Trump	There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time.	0
239	Donald Trump	And we have not even started the big work yet.	0
240	Donald Trump	That starts early next week.	0
241	Donald Trump	Some very big things are going to be announced next week.	0
242	Donald Trump	So we are just getting started.	0
243	Donald Trump	We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.	0
244	Donald Trump	I hope to see you there.	0
245	Donald Trump	And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.	0
246	Donald Trump	Mara, Mara, go ahead.	0
247	Donald Trump	You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.	0
248	Mara Liasson	Why did you fire Mike Flynn?	0
249	Donald Trump	Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.	0
250	Donald Trump	He respectfully gave it.	0
251	Donald Trump	He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.	0
252	Donald Trump	And I was not happy with the way that information was given.	0
253	Donald Trump	He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw.	0
254	Donald Trump	What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.	0
255	Donald Trump	That's the real problem.	0
256	Donald Trump	And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it.	0
257	Donald Trump	In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.	0
258	Donald Trump	It's all fake news.	0
259	Donald Trump	It's all fake news.	0
260	Donald Trump	The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information.	0
261	Donald Trump	It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.	0
262	Donald Trump	I'll give you an example.	0
263	Donald Trump	I called, as you know, Mexico.	0
264	Donald Trump	It was a very, very confidential, classified call.	0
265	Donald Trump	But I called Mexico.	0
266	Donald Trump	And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call.	0
267	Donald Trump	All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see.	0
268	Donald Trump	It's supposed to be secret.	0
269	Donald Trump	It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.	0
270	Donald Trump	Same thing with Australia.	0
271	Donald Trump	All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.	0
272	Donald Trump	The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.	0
273	Donald Trump	Everybody saw this.	0
274	Donald Trump	And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified?	0
275	Donald Trump	How do they do it?	0
276	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
277	Donald Trump	Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.	1
278	Donald Trump	But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.	0
279	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.	0
280	Question	Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?	0
281	Donald Trump	Because when I looked at the information, I said, "I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right."	0
282	Donald Trump	He was coming into office.	0
283	Donald Trump	He looked at the information.	0
284	Donald Trump	He said, "Huh, that's fine."	0
285	Donald Trump	That's what they're supposed to do.	0
286	Donald Trump	They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia.	0
287	Donald Trump	He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries.	0
288	Donald Trump	He's doing the job.	0
289	Donald Trump	You know, he was doing his job.	0
290	Donald Trump	The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember.	0
291	Donald Trump	So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.	0
292	Donald Trump	And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position.	0
293	Donald Trump	And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.	0
294	Donald Trump	But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts.	0
295	Donald Trump	And then he didn't remember.	0
296	Donald Trump	And that just wasn't acceptable to me.	0
297	Donald Trump	Yes?	0
298	Question	President Trump, clarification here.	0
299	Question	During your campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?	0
300	Question	And if so, what was the nature of those conversations...?	0
301	Donald Trump	The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.	0
302	Donald Trump	And it was very much discredited, as you know.	0
303	Donald Trump	It was -- it's a joke.	0
304	Donald Trump	And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.	0
305	Donald Trump	They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part.	0
306	Donald Trump	They -- I hadn't spoken to them.	0
307	Donald Trump	I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him.	0
308	Donald Trump	I don't think I've ever met him.	0
309	Donald Trump	And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time.	0
310	Donald Trump	I don't think I ever met him.	0
311	Donald Trump	Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him.	0
312	Donald Trump	I didn't talk to him ever.	0
313	Donald Trump	And he thought it was a joke.	0
314	Donald Trump	The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call.	0
315	Donald Trump	Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.	0
316	Donald Trump	And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries.	0
317	Donald Trump	That's what he does.	0
318	Donald Trump	I mean, people know that.	0
319	Donald Trump	That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man.	0
320	Donald Trump	He's a respected man.	0
321	Donald Trump	But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that.	0
322	Donald Trump	Everybody knew that.	0
323	Donald Trump	So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.	0
324	Donald Trump	And he said that very forcefully.	0
325	Donald Trump	I saw his statement.	0
326	Donald Trump	He said it very forcefully.	0
327	Donald Trump	Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.	0
328	Donald Trump	So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.	0
329	Donald Trump	And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.	0
330	Donald Trump	I have no loans in Russia.	0
331	Donald Trump	I don't have any deals in Russia.	0
332	Donald Trump	President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.	0
333	Donald Trump	He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.	0
334	Donald Trump	But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country.	0
335	Donald Trump	So that's the extent.	0
336	Donald Trump	Russia is fake news.	0
337	Donald Trump	Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.	0
338	Donald Trump	The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.	0
339	Donald Trump	As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved.	0
340	Donald Trump	But our new people are going in.	0
341	Donald Trump	And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday.	0
342	Donald Trump	And it talked about -- these are front page.	0
343	Donald Trump	So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.	0
344	Donald Trump	So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true.	0
345	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media.	0
346	Donald Trump	I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.	0
347	Donald Trump	But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media.	0
348	Donald Trump	How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?	0
349	Donald Trump	That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story.	0
350	Donald Trump	And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump.	0
351	Donald Trump	They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.	0
352	Donald Trump	And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented.	0
353	Donald Trump	I said give us the retraction.	0
354	Donald Trump	They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.	0
355	Donald Trump	OK, go ahead.	0
356	Question	I am.	0
357	Question	Just wanted to get untangled.	0
358	Question	Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.	0
359	Question	In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008?	0
360	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
361	Question	President Obama, 332.	0
362	Question	George H.W.	0
363	Question	Bush, 426 when he won as President.	0
364	Question	So why should Americans trust --	0
365	Donald Trump	...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given we had a very, very big margin.	0
366	Question	I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?	0
367	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know, I was given that information.	0
368	Donald Trump	I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around.	0
369	Donald Trump	But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...	0
370	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
371	Donald Trump	Go ahead Sir, yes?	0
372	Question	Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?	0
373	Question	Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?	0
374	Question	What -- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing?	0
375	Question	Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.	0
376	Donald Trump	We are.	0
377	Question	Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?	0
378	Donald Trump	Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.	0
379	Donald Trump	The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of.	0
380	Donald Trump	But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.	0
381	Donald Trump	As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong.	0
382	Donald Trump	My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself.	0
383	Donald Trump	He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.	0
384	Donald Trump	It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong.	0
385	Donald Trump	I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said "well I don't see" -- to me, he was doing the job.	0
386	Donald Trump	The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates.	0
387	Donald Trump	And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."	0
388	Donald Trump	But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable.	0
389	Donald Trump	As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.	0
390	Donald Trump	That was very normal.	0
391	Donald Trump	You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.	0
392	Donald Trump	After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.	0
393	Donald Trump	So -- and I do.	0
394	Donald Trump	And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.	0
395	Question	Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...	0
396	Donald Trump	...Go ahead.	0
397	Donald Trump	Finish off then I'll get you.	0
398	Question	I'm sorry.	0
399	Question	What will you do on the leaks?	0
400	Question	You've said twice today...	0
401	Donald Trump	...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious.	0
402	Donald Trump	I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.	0
403	Donald Trump	Those are criminal leaks.	0
404	Donald Trump	They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.	0
405	Donald Trump	You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.	0
406	Donald Trump	We just had Jeff Sessions approved.	0
407	Donald Trump	Injustice, as an example.	0
408	Donald Trump	So, we are looking into that very seriously.	0
409	Donald Trump	It's a criminal act.	0
410	Donald Trump	You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.	0
411	Donald Trump	But I said "you know, it doesn't make sense.	0
412	Donald Trump	That won't happen" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way.	0
413	Donald Trump	Same thing with Australia.	0
414	Donald Trump	I said "that's terrible that it was leaked" but it wasn't that important.	0
415	Donald Trump	But then I said to myself "what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?"	0
416	Donald Trump	What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?	0
417	Donald Trump	Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level?	0
418	Donald Trump	Are you going to be reporting about that too?	0
419	Donald Trump	So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.	0
420	Donald Trump	So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.	0
421	Donald Trump	All this information gets put into the "Washington Post" and gets put into the "New York Times" and I'm saying "what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?	0
422	Donald Trump	What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?	0
423	Donald Trump	We got to stop it.	0
424	Donald Trump	That's why it's a criminal penalty.	0
425	Question	I just want to get you to clarify this very important point.	0
426	Question	Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?	0
427	Question	And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?	0
428	Donald Trump	Well the leaks are real.	0
429	Donald Trump	You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real.	0
430	Donald Trump	You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real.	0
431	Donald Trump	The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.	0
432	Donald Trump	So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it.	0
433	Donald Trump	Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.	0
434	Donald Trump	It's very important to me and especially in this position.	0
435	Donald Trump	It's very important.	0
436	Donald Trump	I don't mind bad stories.	0
437	Donald Trump	I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that.	0
438	Donald Trump	But I'm not OK when it is fake.	0
439	Donald Trump	I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.	0
440	Donald Trump	I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no.	0
441	Donald Trump	It's OK, Jim.	0
442	Donald Trump	It's OK, Jim, you'll have your chance.	0
443	Donald Trump	But I watch others too.	0
444	Donald Trump	You're not the only one so don't feel badly.	0
445	Donald Trump	But I think it should be straight.	0
446	Donald Trump	I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting.	0
447	Donald Trump	I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.	0
448	Donald Trump	People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.	1
449	Donald Trump	I think that's right.	0
450	Donald Trump	I don't know, Peter, is that one right?	0
451	Donald Trump	Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress.	0
452	Donald Trump	But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.	0
453	Donald Trump	I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet.	0
454	Donald Trump	I mean, the numbers are crazy.	0
455	Donald Trump	When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.	0
456	Donald Trump	I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.	0
457	Donald Trump	And that's all they're doing, is delaying.	0
458	Donald Trump	And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going.	0
459	Donald Trump	The only thing they can do is delay.	0
460	Donald Trump	And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.	0
461	Donald Trump	And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine.	0
462	Donald Trump	But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly.	0
463	Donald Trump	This is pure delay tactics.	0
464	Donald Trump	And they say it, and everybody understands it.	0
465	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.	0
466	Question	The first part of my question on contacts.	0
467	Question	Do you definitively say that nobody --	0
468	Donald Trump	Well, I had nothing to do with it.	0
469	Donald Trump	I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
470	Donald Trump	I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything.	0
471	Donald Trump	Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information.	1
472	Donald Trump	They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.	0
473	Donald Trump	Which, by the way, nobody mentions.	0
474	Donald Trump	Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.	0
475	Donald Trump	Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions?	0
476	Donald Trump	It would be the electric chair.	0
477	Donald Trump	OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John.	0
478	Donald Trump	Yes?	0
479	Donald Trump	We'll do you next Jim, I do you next.	0
480	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
481	Question	I just want to clarify one other thing.	0
482	Donald Trump	Yes, yes, sure	0
483	Question	Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador —	0
484	Donald Trump	No, I didn't.	0
485	Question	-- prior to your --	0
486	Donald Trump	No, I didn't.	0
487	Question	-- prior to your --	0
488	Donald Trump	No, I didn't.	0
489	Question	And then fired him —	0
490	Donald Trump	Excuse me. Did you fire him because	0
491	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
492	Donald Trump	No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence.	0
493	Donald Trump	Very simple.	0
494	Donald Trump	Mike was doing his job.	0
495	Donald Trump	He was calling countries and his counterparts.	0
496	Donald Trump	So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it.	0
497	Donald Trump	I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.	0
498	Donald Trump	I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.	0
499	Donald Trump	And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him.	0
500	Donald Trump	And since then, I've watched many other people say that.	0
501	Donald Trump	No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it.	0
502	Donald Trump	OK?	0
503	Donald Trump	Jim?	0
504	Question	Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you.	0
505	Question	I don't hate you.	0
506	Donald Trump	OK.	0
507	Question	So, pass that along —	0
508	Donald Trump	Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.	0
509	Donald Trump	OK?	0
510	Question	If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir —	0
511	Donald Trump	Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people.	0
512	Donald Trump	You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.	0
513	Question	It's pretty good right now, actually.	0
514	Donald Trump	OK, go ahead, John.	0
515	Question	If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.	0
516	Question	You welcomed that.	0
517	Question	At one time —	0
518	Donald Trump	I was OK with it.	0
519	Question	-- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks.	0
520	Question	At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails.	0
521	Question	I'm wondering, sir, if you --	0
522	Donald Trump	Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.	0
523	Question	Then, your numbers were off too.	0
524	Donald Trump	No -- no, but I did say 30.	0
525	Donald Trump	But it was actually higher than that.	0
526	Question	If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during the campaign —	0
527	Donald Trump	OK, fair question.	0
528	Donald Trump	Ready?	0
529	Question	Well, if I may ask you that —	0
530	Donald Trump	No -- no, but let me do one at a time.	0
531	Question	If I may as a follow up?	0
532	Donald Trump	Do you mind?	0
533	Question	Yes, sir.	0
534	Donald Trump	All right.	0
535	Donald Trump	So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information.	0
536	Donald Trump	In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.	0
537	Donald Trump	I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.	0
538	Donald Trump	He said terrible things about her.	0
539	Donald Trump	But it wasn't classified information.	0
540	Donald Trump	But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.	0
541	Donald Trump	I don't want to be hacked.	0
542	Donald Trump	And we did that.	0
543	Donald Trump	And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.	1
544	Donald Trump	The DNC did not do that.	0
545	Donald Trump	And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.	0
546	Donald Trump	But they were hacked and terrible things came in.	0
547	Donald Trump	And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.	0
548	Donald Trump	Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.	0
549	Donald Trump	I would have been headline in every newspaper.	0
550	Donald Trump	I mean, think of it.	0
551	Donald Trump	They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.	0
552	Donald Trump	Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, "I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job."	0
553	Question	And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about.	0
554	Question	You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.	0
555	Question	I guess I don't understand.	0
556	Question	It seems that there's a disconnect there.	0
557	Question	If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?	0
558	Donald Trump	The reporting is fake. Look, look...	0
559	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
560	Donald Trump	You know what it is?	0
561	Donald Trump	Here's the thing.	0
562	Donald Trump	The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.	0
563	Donald Trump	They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved.	0
564	Donald Trump	I'm involved.	0
565	Donald Trump	I've been involved with this stuff all my life.	0
566	Donald Trump	But I'm involved.	0
567	Donald Trump	So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.	0
568	Donald Trump	I just see many, many untruthful things.	0
569	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what else I see.	0
570	Donald Trump	I see tone.	0
571	Donald Trump	You know the word "tone."	0
572	Donald Trump	The tone is such hatred.	0
573	Donald Trump	I'm really not a bad person, by the way.	0
574	Donald Trump	No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.	0
575	Donald Trump	I watched this morning a couple of the networks.	0
576	Donald Trump	And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people.	0
577	Donald Trump	They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.	0
578	Donald Trump	But they have the most honest morning show.	0
579	Donald Trump	That's all I can say.	0
580	Donald Trump	It's the most honest.	0
581	Donald Trump	But the tone, Jim.	0
582	Donald Trump	If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...	0
583	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
584	Donald Trump	Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening.	0
585	Donald Trump	You just take a look at that show.	0
586	Donald Trump	That is a constant hit.	0
587	Donald Trump	The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.	0
588	Donald Trump	The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.	0
589	Donald Trump	But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.	0
590	Donald Trump	And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.	0
591	Donald Trump	Now, I will say this.	0
592	Donald Trump	I watch it.	0
593	Donald Trump	I see it.	0
594	Donald Trump	I'm amazed by it.	0
595	Donald Trump	And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do.	0
596	Donald Trump	The public gets it, you know.	0
597	Donald Trump	Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.	0
598	Donald Trump	They want to throw their placards at CNN.	0
599	Donald Trump	You know.	0
600	Donald Trump	I -- I think you would do much better by being different.	0
601	Donald Trump	But you just take a look.	0
602	Donald Trump	Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.	0
603	Donald Trump	If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.	0
604	Donald Trump	Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK?	0
605	Donald Trump	But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won.	0
606	Donald Trump	Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.	0
607	Donald Trump	OK?	0
608	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
609	Donald Trump	No, that's how I won.	0
610	Donald Trump	I won with news conferences and probably speeches.	0
611	Donald Trump	I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people.	0
612	Donald Trump	That's for sure.	0
613	Donald Trump	But I'm having a good time.	0
614	Donald Trump	Tomorrow, they will say, "Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."	0
615	Donald Trump	I'm not ranting and raving.	0
616	Donald Trump	I'm just telling you.	0
617	Donald Trump	You know, you're dishonest people.	0
618	Donald Trump	But -- but I'm not ranting and raving.	0
619	Donald Trump	I love this.	0
620	Donald Trump	I'm having a good time doing it.	0
621	Donald Trump	But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, "Donald Trump rants and raves."	0
622	Donald Trump	I'm not ranting and raving.	0
623	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
624	Question	If I may, just one more followup...	0
625	Donald Trump	Should I let him have a little bit more?	0
626	Donald Trump	What do you think, Peter?	0
627	Donald Trump	Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?	0
628	Donald Trump	Sit down.	0
629	Donald Trump	Sit down. We'll...	0
630	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
631	Question	Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...	0
632	Donald Trump	I'm changing it from fake news, though.	0
633	Question	Doesn't that under...	0
634	Donald Trump	Very fake news.	0
635	Question	... I know, but aren't you...	0
636	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
637	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
638	Question	Real news, Mr. President, real news.	0
639	Donald Trump	And you're not related to our new...	0
640	Question	I am not related, sir.	0
641	Question	No.	0
642	Question	I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.	0
643	Donald Trump	I looked -- you know, I looked at that name.	0
644	Donald Trump	I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?	0
645	Donald Trump	Alex Acosta.	0
646	Question	I'm sure you checked that out, sir.	0
647	Donald Trump	OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, "No, sir."	0
648	Donald Trump	I said, "Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree."	0
649	Question	But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like "fake news"?	0
650	Question	Why not just say it's a story I don't like.	0
651	Donald Trump	I do that.	0
652	Question	When you call it "fake news," you're undermining confidence in our news media.	0
653	Question	Isn’t that important?	0
654	Donald Trump	No, no.	0
655	Donald Trump	I do that.	0
656	Donald Trump	Here's the thing.	0
657	Donald Trump	OK.	0
658	Donald Trump	I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this.	0
659	Donald Trump	See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.	0
660	Donald Trump	And sometimes I'll say, "Wow, that's going to be a great story."	0
661	Donald Trump	And I'll get killed.	0
662	Donald Trump	I know what's good and bad.	0
663	Donald Trump	I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you.	0
664	Donald Trump	But I know what's good.	0
665	Donald Trump	I know what's bad.	0
666	Donald Trump	And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK.	0
667	Donald Trump	They'll even make it negative.	0
668	Donald Trump	So I understand it.	0
669	Donald Trump	So, because I'm there.	0
670	Donald Trump	I know what was said.	0
671	Donald Trump	I know who's saying it.	0
672	Donald Trump	I'm there.	0
673	Donald Trump	So it's very important to me.	0
674	Donald Trump	Look, I want to see an honest press.	0
675	Donald Trump	When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press.	0
676	Donald Trump	The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore.	0
677	Donald Trump	Now, maybe I had something to do with that.	0
678	Donald Trump	I don't know.	0
679	Donald Trump	But they don't believe you.	0
680	Donald Trump	If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?	0
681	Donald Trump	Of course, he had some questions also.	0
682	Donald Trump	But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster.	0
683	Donald Trump	I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me.	0
684	Donald Trump	But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN, I mean it's story after story after story is bad.	0
685	Donald Trump	I won.	0
686	Donald Trump	I won.	0
687	Donald Trump	And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos.	0
688	Donald Trump	We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press.	0
689	Donald Trump	You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.	0
690	Donald Trump	And I'm saying "here's my chief of staff," a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.	0
691	Donald Trump	I mean, he won the election, right?	0
692	Donald Trump	We won the presidency.	0
693	Donald Trump	We got some senators, we got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job.	0
694	Donald Trump	And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said "you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires."	0
695	Donald Trump	I mean, they're fake.	0
696	Donald Trump	They're not true.	0
697	Donald Trump	And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim.	0
698	Donald Trump	I mean that.	0
699	Donald Trump	I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.	0
700	Donald Trump	I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff or somebody, you know -- you know, whatever reason.	0
701	Donald Trump	But -- and I understand that.	0
702	Donald Trump	But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it.	0
703	Donald Trump	They see it.	0
704	Donald Trump	They see it's not fair.	0
705	Donald Trump	You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.	0
706	Donald Trump	And the public is smart, they understand it.	0
707	Donald Trump	Go ahead. We have no doubt that your latest story is	0
708	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
709	Donald Trump	.	0
710	Question	But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news?	0
711	Question	And secondly --	0
712	Donald Trump	...I think they don't believe it.	0
713	Donald Trump	I don't think the public -- that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.	0
714	Donald Trump	I don't think they believe it.	0
715	Donald Trump	Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse.	0
716	Donald Trump	That's a ruse.	0
717	Donald Trump	And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.	0
718	Donald Trump	Now tomorrow, you'll say "Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible."	0
719	Donald Trump	It's not terrible.	0
720	Donald Trump	It's good.	0
721	Donald Trump	We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.	0
722	Donald Trump	We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.	1
723	Donald Trump	You know what uranium is, right?	0
724	Donald Trump	This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.	0
725	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about that.	0
726	Donald Trump	I didn't do anything for Russia.	0
727	Donald Trump	I've done nothing for Russia.	0
728	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.	0
729	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember?	0
730	Donald Trump	With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks.	0
731	Donald Trump	Here, take a look.	0
732	Donald Trump	He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?	0
733	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton -- that was the reset, remember it said reset?	0
734	Donald Trump	Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.	0
735	Donald Trump	If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing.	0
736	Donald Trump	We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him.	0
737	Donald Trump	I said "I know politically it's probably not good for me."	0
738	Donald Trump	The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.	0
739	Donald Trump	Everyone in this country's going to say "oh, it's so great."	0
740	Donald Trump	That's not great.	0
741	Donald Trump	That's not great.	0
742	Donald Trump	I would love to be able to get along with Russia.	0
743	Donald Trump	Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack.	0
744	Donald Trump	Look where we are now.	0
745	Donald Trump	Look where we are now.	0
746	Donald Trump	So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff.	0
747	Donald Trump	But -- but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.	0
748	Donald Trump	Maybe it is.	0
749	Donald Trump	But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.	0
750	Donald Trump	And probably Putin said "you know."	0
751	Donald Trump	He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying "you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely.	0
752	Donald Trump	It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story."	0
753	Donald Trump	OK?	0
754	Donald Trump	And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia -- and by the way, China and Japan and everyone.	0
755	Donald Trump	If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.	0
756	Question	Is tax reform on the line?	0
757	Question	Mr. President?	0
758	Question	Mr. President?	0
759	Question	Mr. President, since you...	0
760	Donald Trump	Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.	0
761	Donald Trump	We're doing Obamacare.	0
762	Donald Trump	We're in final stages.	0
763	Donald Trump	We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.	0
764	Donald Trump	And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.	0
765	Donald Trump	It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.	0
766	Donald Trump	So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid-March.	0
767	Donald Trump	And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.	0
768	Donald Trump	Yes?	0
769	Question	Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.	0
770	Question	Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.	0
771	Donald Trump	OK.	0
772	Question	You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.	0
773	Donald Trump	Not good.	0
774	Question	There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.	0
775	Donald Trump	Not good.	0
776	Question	I listened to you during the campaign ...	0
777	Donald Trump	Excuse me, excuse me.	0
778	Donald Trump	When did it happen?	0
779	Donald Trump	It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, "Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us."	0
780	Donald Trump	Because the -- you have to understand.	0
781	Donald Trump	If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, "Oh, isn't that wonderful."	0
782	Donald Trump	But I know you well enough.	0
783	Donald Trump	Then you would say, "Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that." Look, all of the...	0
784	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
785	Donald Trump	I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...	0
786	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
787	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.	0
788	Donald Trump	Wait, wait.	0
789	Donald Trump	Excuse me just one second.	0
790	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
791	Donald Trump	All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.	0
792	Donald Trump	So Hillary Clinton tries a re-set.	0
793	Donald Trump	It failed.	0
794	Donald Trump	They all tried.	0
795	Donald Trump	But I'm different than those people.	0
796	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
797	Question	How are you interpreting those moves?	0
798	Question	And what do you intend to do about them?	0
799	Question	Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?	0
800	Donald Trump	I have.	0
801	Donald Trump	I have.	0
802	Donald Trump	And I'm so beautifully represented.	0
803	Donald Trump	I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.	0
804	Donald Trump	He's going to be fantastic.	0
805	Donald Trump	Yes, I think that I've already...	0
806	Question	Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?	0
807	Donald Trump	No, I don't think so.	0
808	Donald Trump	I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.	0
809	Donald Trump	I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.	0
810	Donald Trump	Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.	0
811	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.	0
812	Donald Trump	I don't know.	0
813	Donald Trump	We might.	0
814	Donald Trump	We might not.	0
815	Donald Trump	But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.	0
816	Donald Trump	But you know what?	0
817	Donald Trump	I want to do the right thing for the American people.	0
818	Donald Trump	And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.	0
819	Donald Trump	If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
820	Donald Trump	There's no up-side.	0
821	Donald Trump	We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
822	Donald Trump	I have been briefed.	0
823	Donald Trump	And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.	0
824	Donald Trump	They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.	0
825	Donald Trump	If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
826	Question	So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...	0
827	Donald Trump	Who did I say is not good?	0
828	Question	No, I read off the three things that have recently happened.	0
829	Question	Each one of them you said they're not good.	0
830	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
831	Donald Trump	No, it's not good, but they happened.	0
832	Question	But do they damage the relationship?	0
833	Question	Do they undermine...	0
834	Donald Trump	They all happened recently. No...	0
835	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
836	Question	... this country's ability to work with Russia?	0
837	Donald Trump	They all happened recently.	0
838	Donald Trump	And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.	0
839	Donald Trump	Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.	0
840	Donald Trump	And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?	0
841	Donald Trump	Does anybody in this room really believe that?	0
842	Donald Trump	OK?	0
843	Donald Trump	But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal.	0
844	Donald Trump	She had the re-set.	0
845	Donald Trump	She gave all that valuable uranium away.	0
846	Donald Trump	She did other things.	0
847	Donald Trump	You know, they say I'm close to Russia.	0
848	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.	0
849	Donald Trump	She's close to Russia.	0
850	Question	Can we...	0
851	Donald Trump	I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?	0
852	Donald Trump	You know what I gave?	0
853	Donald Trump	Nothing.	0
854	Question	Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?	0
855	Donald Trump	I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do.	0
856	Donald Trump	I don't talk about military response.	0
857	Donald Trump	I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months.	0
858	Donald Trump	We are going to attack Mosul in four months.	0
859	Donald Trump	Then three months later, "We are going to attack Mosul in one month."	0
860	Donald Trump	Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.	0
861	Donald Trump	In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.	0
862	Donald Trump	Do you know why?	0
863	Donald Trump	Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that.	0
864	Donald Trump	And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.	0
865	Donald Trump	So I don't have to tell you.	0
866	Donald Trump	I don't want to be one of these guys that say, "Yes, here's what we're going to do."	0
867	Donald Trump	I don't have to do that.	0
868	Donald Trump	I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.	0
869	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
870	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.	0
871	Donald Trump	I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.	0
872	Donald Trump	And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran.	0
873	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
874	Donald Trump	Because they shouldn't know.	0
875	Donald Trump	And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.	0
876	Donald Trump	So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you.	0
877	Donald Trump	But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.	0
878	Donald Trump	OK.	0
879	Question	Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
880	Question	The trouble...	0
881	Donald Trump	Where are you from?	0
882	Question	BBC.	0
883	Donald Trump	Here's another beauty.	0
884	Question	That's a good line.	0
885	Question	Impartial, free and fair.	0
886	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
887	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
888	Question	Mr. President...	0
889	Donald Trump	Just like CNN right?	0
890	Question	On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.	0
891	Question	On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...	0
892	Donald Trump	Yeah, I do.	0
893	Donald Trump	I do.	0
894	Donald Trump	Let me tell you about this government...	0
895	Question	Were there any mistakes...	0
896	Donald Trump	Wait.	0
897	Donald Trump	Wait.	0
898	Donald Trump	I know who you are.	0
899	Donald Trump	Just wait.	0
900	Donald Trump	Let me tell you about the travel ban.	0
901	Donald Trump	We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban.	0
902	Donald Trump	But we had a bad court.	0
903	Donald Trump	Got a bad decision.	0
904	Donald Trump	We had a court that's been overturned.	0
905	Donald Trump	Again, may be wrong.	0
906	Donald Trump	But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.	0
907	Donald Trump	We had a bad decision.	0
908	Donald Trump	We're going to keep going with that decision.	0
909	Donald Trump	We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time.	0
910	Donald Trump	But we had a bad decision.	0
911	Donald Trump	That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban.	0
912	Donald Trump	You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.	0
913	Donald Trump	You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.	0
914	Donald Trump	Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.	0
915	Donald Trump	We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.	0
916	Donald Trump	Very bad for the safety and security of our country.	0
917	Donald Trump	The rollout was perfect.	0
918	Donald Trump	Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing.	0
919	Donald Trump	I said this to my people.	0
920	Donald Trump	Give them a one-month period of time.	0
921	Donald Trump	But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.	0
922	Donald Trump	You do agree there are bad people out there, right?	0
923	Donald Trump	That not everybody that's like you.	0
924	Donald Trump	You have some bad people out there.	0
925	Donald Trump	Kelly said you can't do that.	0
926	Donald Trump	And he was right.	0
927	Donald Trump	As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it.	0
928	Donald Trump	I said how about one week?	0
929	Donald Trump	He said no good.	0
930	Donald Trump	You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.	0
931	Donald Trump	Now nobody ever reports that.	0
932	Donald Trump	But that's why we did it quickly.	0
933	Donald Trump	Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect.	0
934	Donald Trump	The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.	0
935	Donald Trump	Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly.	0
936	Donald Trump	Very, very strongly.	0
937	Donald Trump	But we need help.	0
938	Donald Trump	And we need help by getting that executive order passed.	0
939	Question	Just a brief follow-up.	0
940	Question	But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...	0
941	Donald Trump	Yes?	0
942	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
943	Question	Thank you.	0
944	Question	I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.	0
945	Question	Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?	0
946	Donald Trump	Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing.	0
947	Donald Trump	So that's one person.	0
948	Donald Trump	But he was dealing, as he should have been.	0
949	Question	During the election?	0
950	Donald Trump	No.	0
951	Donald Trump	Nobody that I know of.	0
952	Donald Trump	Nobody...	0
953	Question	So you're not aware of any contact during the course..	0
954	Donald Trump	Look, look, look...	0
955	Question	... of the election?	0
956	Donald Trump	How many times do I have to answer this question?	0
957	Question	Can you just say yes or no?	0
958	Donald Trump	Russia is a ruse.	0
959	Donald Trump	I know you have to get up and ask a question.	0
960	Donald Trump	It's so important.	0
961	Donald Trump	Russia is a ruse.	0
962	Donald Trump	I have nothing to do with Russia.	1
963	Donald Trump	Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years.	1
964	Donald Trump	Don't speak to people from Russia.	0
965	Donald Trump	Not that I wouldn't.	0
966	Donald Trump	I just have nobody to speak to.	0
967	Donald Trump	I spoke to Putin twice.	0
968	Donald Trump	He called me on the election.	0
969	Donald Trump	I told you this.	0
970	Donald Trump	And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.	0
971	Donald Trump	We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time.	0
972	Donald Trump	I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified.	0
973	Donald Trump	So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.	0
974	Donald Trump	But we had a very, very good talk.	0
975	Donald Trump	I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
976	Donald Trump	To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.	0
977	Donald Trump	Now, Manafort has totally denied it.	0
978	Donald Trump	He denied it.	0
979	Donald Trump	Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.	0
980	Donald Trump	I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.	0
981	Donald Trump	But people knew that.	0
982	Donald Trump	Everybody knew that.	0
983	Question	But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?	0
984	Donald Trump	You know what?	0
985	Donald Trump	He said no.	0
986	Donald Trump	I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election.	0
987	Donald Trump	You know that, right?	0
988	Donald Trump	He was replaced long before the election.	0
989	Donald Trump	When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.	0
990	Donald Trump	But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place.	0
991	Donald Trump	He was only there for a short period of time.	0
992	Question	Mr. President...	0
993	Donald Trump	How much longer should we stay here, folks?	0

1040	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1041	Jake Turx	So, first of all, my name is Jake Turx from Ami Magazine.	0
1042	Jake Turx	Despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren—you are their zayde	0
1043	SYSTEM	[editor's note: grandfather]	0
1044	Jake Turx	.	0
1045	Jake Turx	However, what we are concerned about and what we haven't really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.	0
1046	Jake Turx	There's been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across country in the last couple of weeks.	0
1047	Jake Turx	There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to—	0
1048	Donald Trump	You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.	0
1049	Donald Trump	And it's not.	0
1050	Donald Trump	It's not a simple question, not a fair question.	0
1051	Donald Trump	Okay, sit down, I understand the rest of your question.	0
1052	Donald Trump	So here's the story, folks.	0
1053	Donald Trump	Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.	0
1054	Donald Trump	Number two, racism.	0
1055	Donald Trump	The least racist person.	0
1056	Donald Trump	In fact, we did relatively well, relative to other people running as a Republican—quiet, quiet, quiet.	0
1057	Donald Trump	See, he lied about—he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.	0
1058	Donald Trump	So, welcome to the world of the media.	0
1059	Donald Trump	But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge.	0
1060	Donald Trump	I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me—and you heard the prime minister, you heard Betanyahu	0
1061	SYSTEM	[sic]	0
1062	Donald Trump	yesterday—did you hear him?—Bibi--he said, "I've known Donald Trump for a long time," and then he said, "Forget it."	0
1063	Donald Trump	So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.	0
1064	Donald Trump	Just shows you about the press but that's the way the press is.	0
1065	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.	0
1066	Donald Trump	Go ahead. Thank you, I'm Lisa Desjardins from the...	0
1067	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
1068	Donald Trump	See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.	0
1069	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.	0
1070	Question	Lisa Desjardins  from the PBS Newshour.	0
1071	Question	On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week?	0
1072	Question	Even its broad outlines?	0
1073	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
1074	Question	Will it be focused on specific...	0
1075	Donald Trump	It's a very fair question.	0
1076	Question	...countries?	0
1077	Question	And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.	0
1078	Donald Trump	Right.	0
1079	Question	What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?	0
1080	Donald Trump	We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.	0
1081	Donald Trump	To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.	0
1082	Donald Trump	In many cases, not in all cases.	0
1083	Donald Trump	And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too.	0
1084	Donald Trump	But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly.	0
1085	Donald Trump	They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.	0
1086	Donald Trump	We're gonna deal with DACA with heart.	0
1087	Donald Trump	I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right.	0
1088	Donald Trump	And I appreciate your understanding on that.	0
1089	Donald Trump	But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids.	0
1090	Donald Trump	And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.	0
1091	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough.	0
1092	Donald Trump	As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.	0
1093	Donald Trump	But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more.	0
1094	Donald Trump	But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.	0
1095	Donald Trump	And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.	0
1096	Donald Trump	OK? Mr. President...	0
1097	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
1098	Question	...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?	0
1099	Donald Trump	Yes.	0
1100	Question	And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.	0
1101	Question	Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?	0
1102	Question	And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?	0
1103	Donald Trump	Now, that's what I call a nice question.	0
1104	Donald Trump	That is very -- who are you with?	0
1105	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
1106	Donald Trump	Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right?	0
1107	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
1108	Donald Trump	Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.	0
1109	Donald Trump	And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.	0
1110	Donald Trump	And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans.	0
1111	Donald Trump	And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.	0
1112	Donald Trump	She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties.	0
1113	Donald Trump	Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate.	0
1114	Donald Trump	I think she's a great representative for this country.	0
1115	Donald Trump	And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say.	0
1116	Donald Trump	I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model.	0
1117	Donald Trump	She did really well.	0
1118	Donald Trump	She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people.	0
1119	Donald Trump	She was a very private person.	0
1120	Donald Trump	She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find.	0
1121	Donald Trump	And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair.	0
1122	Donald Trump	And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.	0
1123	Donald Trump	I'll just tell you this.	0
1124	Donald Trump	I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady.	0
1125	Donald Trump	She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.	0
1126	Donald Trump	And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.	0
1127	Donald Trump	And they're not doing this for money.	0
1128	Donald Trump	They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them.	0
1129	Donald Trump	And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.	0
1130	Donald Trump	OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.	0
1131	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
1132	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1133	Question	Mr. Trump?	0
1134	Donald Trump	Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.	0
1135	Question	It doesn't have to be a bad question.	0
1136	Donald Trump	Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.	0
1137	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
1138	Question	Well, thank you so much.	0
1139	Question	Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities.	0
1140	Question	That was one of your platforms during your campaign.	0
1141	Question	Now you're --	0
1142	Donald Trump	Fix the inner cities.	0
1143	Question	— president.	0
1144	Question	Fixing the inner cities.	0
1145	Donald Trump	Yep.	0
1146	Question	What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon?	0
1147	Question	See, it wasn't bad, was it?	0
1148	Donald Trump	That was very professional and very good.	0
1149	Question	I'm very professional.	0
1150	Donald Trump	We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself.	0
1151	Donald Trump	But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.	0
1152	Donald Trump	But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.	0
1153	Donald Trump	As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.	0
1154	Donald Trump	I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.	0
1155	Donald Trump	We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get.	0
1156	Donald Trump	And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.	0
1157	Donald Trump	And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.	0
1158	Donald Trump	So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime.	0
1159	Donald Trump	We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.	0
1160	Donald Trump	It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly.	0
1161	Donald Trump	But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.	0
1162	Donald Trump	You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime.	0
1163	Donald Trump	You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it.	0
1164	Donald Trump	They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.	0
1165	Donald Trump	They're living in hell.	0
1166	Donald Trump	We can't let that happen.	0
1167	Donald Trump	So, we're going to be very, very strong.	0
1168	Donald Trump	That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years.	0
1169	Donald Trump	It's been festering for many, many years.	0
1170	Donald Trump	But we have places in this country that we have to fix.	0
1171	Donald Trump	We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there.	0
1172	Donald Trump	Hispanic American people.	0
1173	Donald Trump	We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell.	0
1174	Donald Trump	I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.	0
1175	Donald Trump	There are two Chicagos, as you know.	0
1176	Donald Trump	There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe.	0
1177	Donald Trump	There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts.	0
1178	Donald Trump	So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.	0
1179	Donald Trump	I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.	0
1180	Donald Trump	OK?	0
1181	Question	Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --	0
1182	Donald Trump	Am I going to include who?	0
1183	Question	Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional --	0
1184	Donald Trump	Well, I would.	0
1185	Donald Trump	I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?	0
1186	Question	-- Hispanic Caucus --	0
1187	Donald Trump	Do you want to set up the meeting?	0
1188	Question	No -- no -- no.	0
1189	Question	I'm not --	0
1190	Donald Trump	Are they friends of yours?	0
1191	Question	I'm just a reporter.	0
1192	Donald Trump	Well, then set up the meeting.	0
1193	Question	I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.	0
1194	Donald Trump	Let's go set up a meeting.	0
1195	Donald Trump	I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.	0
1196	Donald Trump	I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus.	0
1197	Donald Trump	I think it's great.	0
1198	Donald Trump	I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited.	0
1199	Donald Trump	And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically.	0
1200	Donald Trump	I can't have that meeting.	0
1201	Donald Trump	I was all set to have the meeting.	0
1202	Donald Trump	You know, we called him and called him.	0
1203	Donald Trump	And he was all set.	0
1204	Donald Trump	I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.	0
1205	Question	I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.	0
1206	Donald Trump	He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him.	0
1207	Donald Trump	Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem.	0
1208	Donald Trump	But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight.	0
1209	Donald Trump	He was probably told - he was probably told "don't meet with Trump.	0
1210	Donald Trump	It's bad politics."	0
1211	Donald Trump	And that's part of the problem in this country.	0
1212	Donald Trump	OK, one more.	0
1213	Question	Yes, Mr. President, two questions --	0
1214	Donald Trump	No, no, one question.	0
1215	Donald Trump	Two we can't handle.	0
1216	Donald Trump	This room can't handle two.	0

1230	Donald Trump	No.	0
1231	Donald Trump	But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side.	0
