1	Donald Trump	Thank you, Phoenix.	0
2	Donald Trump	I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart.	0
3	Donald Trump	I love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November.	0
4	Donald Trump	Tonight is not going to be a normal rally speech.	0
5	Donald Trump	Instead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration.	0
6	Donald Trump	I have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico -- a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country.	0
7	Donald Trump	Just like I am a man who loves the United States.	0
8	Donald Trump	We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.	0
9	Donald Trump	We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations.	0
10	Donald Trump	It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation.	0
11	Donald Trump	This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries.	0
12	Donald Trump	But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington.	0
13	Donald Trump	There is no other way.	0
14	Donald Trump	The truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes.	0
15	Donald Trump	But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.	0
16	Donald Trump	Today you will get the truth.	0
17	Donald Trump	The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians.	0
18	Donald Trump	Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people.	0
19	Donald Trump	When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.	0
20	Donald Trump	Immigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.	0
21	Donald Trump	But if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues.	0
22	Donald Trump	For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions.	0
23	Donald Trump	These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.	0
24	Donald Trump	We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.	0
25	Donald Trump	It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.	0
26	Donald Trump	Then there is the issue of security.	0
27	Donald Trump	Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.	0
28	Donald Trump	I have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders.	0
29	Donald Trump	They will be joining me on the stage later today.	0
30	Donald Trump	Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration.	0
31	Donald Trump	This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.	0
32	Donald Trump	The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House.	0
33	Donald Trump	He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.	0
34	Donald Trump	Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.	0
35	Donald Trump	Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.	0
36	Donald Trump	He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.	0
37	Donald Trump	Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.	0
38	Donald Trump	Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home.	0
39	Donald Trump	The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.	0
40	Donald Trump	In California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.	0
41	Donald Trump	Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.	0
42	Donald Trump	A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.	0
43	Donald Trump	On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.	1
44	Donald Trump	For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.	0
45	Donald Trump	While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.	0
46	Donald Trump	But these facts are never reported.	0
47	Donald Trump	Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally.	0
48	Donald Trump	The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants -- or however many there may be.	1
49	Donald Trump	That has never been the central issue.	0
50	Donald Trump	It will never be the central issue.	0
51	Donald Trump	Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.	0
52	Donald Trump	Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status.	1
53	Donald Trump	To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people.	0
54	Donald Trump	Nothing even comes a close second.	0
55	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated.	0
56	Donald Trump	But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death.	0
57	Donald Trump	No, she's only talking about families who came here in violation of the law.	0
58	Donald Trump	We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity.	0
59	Donald Trump	We will be fair, just and compassionate to all.	0
60	Donald Trump	But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens.	0
61	Donald Trump	President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.	1
62	Donald Trump	President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention -- and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.	0
63	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants -- breaking the federal budget.	1
64	Donald Trump	On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers.	0
65	Donald Trump	This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term.	0
66	Donald Trump	Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan -- about which she has not answered a single substantive question -- let me tell you about my plan.	0
67	Donald Trump	While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations.	0
68	Donald Trump	I also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies.	0
69	Donald Trump	Number One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border.	0
70	Donald Trump	On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border.	0
71	Donald Trump	We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
72	Donald Trump	Number Two: End Catch-And-Release	0
73	Donald Trump	Under my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.	0
74	Donald Trump	Number Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.	0
75	Donald Trump	According to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country.	0
76	Donald Trump	We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement.	0
77	Donald Trump	Beyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice.	0
78	Donald Trump	But their days on the run will soon be over.	0
79	Donald Trump	They go out, and they go out fast.	0
80	Donald Trump	Moving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings.	0
81	Donald Trump	We will terminate the Obama Administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.	0
82	Donald Trump	Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities -- these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.	1
83	Donald Trump	My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens.	0
84	Donald Trump	We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program.	0
85	Donald Trump	We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails.	0
86	Donald Trump	Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration.	0
87	Donald Trump	This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.	0
88	Donald Trump	On my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass 'Kate's Law' -- named for Kate Steinle -- to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.	0
89	Donald Trump	Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant.	0
90	Donald Trump	The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed.	0
91	Donald Trump	We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.	0
92	Donald Trump	Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.	0
93	Donald Trump	The local police know who every one of these criminals are.	0
94	Donald Trump	There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years.	0
95	Donald Trump	And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.	0
96	Donald Trump	We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.	0
97	Donald Trump	We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations.	0
98	Donald Trump	I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them.	0
99	Donald Trump	The endorsement I've received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say.	0
100	Donald Trump	Number Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary Cities	0
101	Donald Trump	We will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths.	0
102	Donald Trump	Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.	0
103	Donald Trump	Number Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws	0
104	Donald Trump	We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.	0
105	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs -- including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court.	0
106	Donald Trump	Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.	0
107	Donald Trump	Clinton's plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before.	0
108	Donald Trump	In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office.	0
109	Donald Trump	In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced.	0
110	Donald Trump	As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities.	0
111	Donald Trump	But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement -- and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs.	0
112	Donald Trump	Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation -- that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.	0
113	Donald Trump	Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges -- that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current Administration.	0
114	Donald Trump	Number Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur	0
115	Donald Trump	According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States.	0
116	Donald Trump	The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.	0
117	Donald Trump	As soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.	0
118	Donald Trump	Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.	0
119	Donald Trump	For the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.	0
120	Donald Trump	Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.	0
121	Donald Trump	For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan -- in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.	0
122	Donald Trump	Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure.	0
123	Donald Trump	Number Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported	0
124	Donald Trump	There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals.	1
125	Donald Trump	Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities.	0
126	Donald Trump	There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year.	0
127	Donald Trump	Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.	0
128	Donald Trump	The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.	0
129	Donald Trump	According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back.	0
130	Donald Trump	Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch -- she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.	0
131	Donald Trump	Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate.	0
132	Donald Trump	Number Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.	0
133	Donald Trump	For years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed.	0
134	Donald Trump	In my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports.	0
135	Donald Trump	Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left.	1
136	Donald Trump	Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security.	0
137	Donald Trump	The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and 'would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.'	0
138	Donald Trump	Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas.	0
139	Donald Trump	Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration.	0
140	Donald Trump	If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave -- the Obama-Clinton policy -- then we have a completely open border.	0
141	Donald Trump	We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.	0
142	Donald Trump	Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.	0
143	Donald Trump	We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.	0
144	Donald Trump	Immigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals.	0
145	Donald Trump	It exists to protect all aspects of American life -- the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else.	0
146	Donald Trump	That is why immigration limits are established in the first place.	0
147	Donald Trump	If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.	0
148	Donald Trump	I will enforce all of our immigration laws.	0
149	Donald Trump	The same goes for government benefits.	0
150	Donald Trump	The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance.	0
151	Donald Trump	This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury.	0
152	Donald Trump	Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal.	0
153	Donald Trump	Number 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers	0
154	Donald Trump	We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.	0
155	Donald Trump	Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country.	0
156	Donald Trump	But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration -- as we have following previous immigration waves -- to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility.	0
157	Donald Trump	Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.	0
158	Donald Trump	The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:	0
159	Donald Trump	To keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms	0
160	Donald Trump	To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient.	0
161	Donald Trump	We need a system that serves our needs -- remember, it's America First.	0
162	Donald Trump	To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency	0
163	Donald Trump	And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.	0
164	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.	0
165	Donald Trump	We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago.	0
166	Donald Trump	To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them.	0
167	Donald Trump	We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?	0
168	Donald Trump	Let's talk about the big picture	0
169	Donald Trump	These ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years.	0
170	Donald Trump	Because I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family.	0
171	Donald Trump	We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail.	0
172	Donald Trump	Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease.	0
173	Donald Trump	We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities.	0
174	Donald Trump	For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above.	0
175	Donald Trump	Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.	0
176	Donald Trump	We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.	0
177	Donald Trump	There will be no amnesty.	0
178	Donald Trump	Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.	0
179	Donald Trump	This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays.	0
180	Donald Trump	People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized.	0
181	Donald Trump	Those days are over.	0
182	Donald Trump	In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals -- and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system -- then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain.	0
183	Donald Trump	That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.	0
184	Donald Trump	Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis.	0
185	Donald Trump	All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security.	0
186	Donald Trump	That is the only conversation we should be having at this time.	0
187	Donald Trump	Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing -- and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.	0
188	Donald Trump	These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.	0
189	Donald Trump	What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement.	0
190	Donald Trump	The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.	0
191	Donald Trump	This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better.	0
192	Donald Trump	This is it.	0
193	Donald Trump	We won't get another opportunity -- it will be too late.	0
194	Donald Trump	So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for -- and who we are fighting for.	0
195	Donald Trump	So I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.	0
196	SYSTEM	[[PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS -- EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD INTO THE MICROPHONE]]	0
197	Donald Trump	Now is the time for these voices to be heard.	0
198	Donald Trump	Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.	0
199	Donald Trump	Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.	0
200	Donald Trump	Let's fix this problem.	0
201	Donald Trump	Let's secure our border.	0
202	Donald Trump	Let's stop the drugs and the crime.	0
203	Donald Trump	Let's protect our Social Security and Medicare.	0
204	Donald Trump	And let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country.	0
205	Donald Trump	Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.	0
206	Donald Trump	Together, we can save America itself.	0
207	Donald Trump	Join me in this mission to Make America Great Again.	0
208	Donald Trump	Thank you, and God Bless you all!	0
