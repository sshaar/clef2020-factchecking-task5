1	Sean Spicer	Morning.	0
2	Sean Spicer	Thanks for being here.	0
3	Sean Spicer	We are now nine away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States.	0
4	Sean Spicer	It's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions.	0
5	Sean Spicer	After the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.	0
6	Sean Spicer	Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night.	0
7	Sean Spicer	It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.	0
8	Sean Spicer	According to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report.	0
9	Sean Spicer	The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, "Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet."	0
10	Sean Spicer	The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.	0
11	Sean Spicer	The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple.	0
12	Sean Spicer	One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign.	0
13	Sean Spicer	These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Carter Page.	0
14	Sean Spicer	Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign.	0
15	Sean Spicer	Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time.	0
16	Sean Spicer	We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.	0
17	Sean Spicer	In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague.	0
18	Sean Spicer	A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game.	0
19	Sean Spicer	One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen.	0
20	Sean Spicer	For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.	0
21	Sean Spicer	With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.	0
22	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
23	Mike Pence	We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America.	0
24	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
25	Mike Pence	I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.	0
26	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
27	Mike Pence	Now, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive.	0
28	Mike Pence	But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring.	0
29	Mike Pence	To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.	0
30	Mike Pence	Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward.	0
31	Mike Pence	Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.	0
32	Mike Pence	You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be.	0
33	Mike Pence	But with freedom comes responsibility.	0
34	Mike Pence	And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.	0
35	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
36	Mike Pence	But today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again.	0
37	Mike Pence	And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.	0
38	Mike Pence	So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.	0
39	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
40	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
41	Donald Trump	It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.	1
42	Donald Trump	I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you.	0
43	Donald Trump	We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies?	0
44	Donald Trump	Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.	0
45	Donald Trump	A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released.	0
46	Donald Trump	But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.	0
47	Donald Trump	So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room.	0
48	Donald Trump	I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that.	0
49	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you.	0
50	Donald Trump	OK?	0
51	Donald Trump	All right.	0
52	Donald Trump	We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks.	0
53	Donald Trump	I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country.	0
54	Donald Trump	A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.	0
55	Donald Trump	You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country.	0
56	Donald Trump	Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.	0
57	Donald Trump	I appreciate that from Ford.	0
58	Donald Trump	I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler.	0
59	Donald Trump	I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be.	0
60	Donald Trump	I think a lot of people will be following.	0
61	Donald Trump	I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.	0
62	Donald Trump	We've got to get our drug industry back.	0
63	Donald Trump	Our drug industry has been disastrous.	0
64	Donald Trump	They're leaving left and right.	0
65	Donald Trump	They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.	0
66	Donald Trump	And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.	0
67	Donald Trump	Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs.	0
68	Donald Trump	We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.	0
69	Donald Trump	And we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.	0
70	Donald Trump	I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F--35, you've been reading about it.	0
71	Donald Trump	And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.	0
72	Donald Trump	I don't like that.	0
73	Donald Trump	And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic.	0
74	Donald Trump	I've really gotten to know them well.	0
75	Donald Trump	And we're going to do some big things on the F--35 program, and perhaps the F--18 program.	0
76	Donald Trump	And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better.	0
77	Donald Trump	And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.	0
78	Donald Trump	So, we've been very, very much involved, and other things.	0
79	Donald Trump	We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here.	0
80	Donald Trump	There are no -- they're going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country.	0
81	Donald Trump	And they're very excited.	0
82	Donald Trump	And I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here.	0
83	Donald Trump	They would not be in my office.	0
84	Donald Trump	They would not be in anybody else's office.	0
85	Donald Trump	They'd be building and doing things in other countries.	0
86	Donald Trump	So, there's a great spirit going on right now.	0
87	Donald Trump	A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.	0
88	Donald Trump	We're going to create jobs.	0
89	Donald Trump	I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.	0
90	Donald Trump	And I mean that, I really -- I'm going to work very hard on that.	0
91	Donald Trump	We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job.	0
92	Donald Trump	And I'm very proud of what we've done.	0
93	Donald Trump	And we haven't even gotten there yet.	0
94	Donald Trump	I look very much forward to the inauguration.	0
95	Donald Trump	It's going to be a beautiful event.	0
96	Donald Trump	We have great talent, tremendous talent.	0
97	Donald Trump	And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military.	0
98	Donald Trump	And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible.	0
99	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very, very elegant day.	0
100	Donald Trump	The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful.	0
101	Donald Trump	And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.	0
102	Donald Trump	It's a movement like the world has never seen before.	0
103	Donald Trump	It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect.	0
104	Donald Trump	And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't.	0
105	Donald Trump	And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in.	0
106	Donald Trump	And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated.	0
107	Donald Trump	And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security.	0
108	Donald Trump	They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.	0
109	Donald Trump	And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin.	0
110	Donald Trump	And we'll do a news release in a little while.	0
111	Donald Trump	Tell you about David, he's fantastic -- he's fantastic.	0
112	Donald Trump	He will do a truly great job.	0
113	Donald Trump	One of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans.	0
114	Donald Trump	Our veterans have been treated horribly.	0
115	Donald Trump	They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor.	0
116	Donald Trump	By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal.	0
117	Donald Trump	Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen.	0
118	Donald Trump	So, David is going to do a fantastic job.	0
119	Donald Trump	We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David.	0
120	Donald Trump	And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have.	0
121	Donald Trump	And we're gonna set up a -- a group.	0
122	Donald Trump	These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line.	0
123	Donald Trump	And they're going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.	0
124	Donald Trump	Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business.	0
125	Donald Trump	And we're gonna straighten out the V.A.	0
126	Donald Trump	for our veterans.	0
127	Donald Trump	I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly.	0
128	Donald Trump	So, you'll get the information on David.	0
129	Donald Trump	And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does.	0
130	Donald Trump	We looked long and hard.	0
131	Donald Trump	We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good.	0
132	Donald Trump	But we had a lot of talent.	0
133	Donald Trump	And we think this election will be something that will, with time -- with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.	0
134	Donald Trump	OK, questions?	0
135	Donald Trump	Yes, John?	0
136	Reporter	Thanks so much.	0
137	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
138	Reporter	Appreciate it.	0
139	Reporter	A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on.	0
140	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
141	Reporter	First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations?	0
142	Reporter	And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC?	0
143	Reporter	And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?	0
144	Donald Trump	OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified.	0
145	Donald Trump	So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.	0
146	Donald Trump	And -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us.	0
147	Donald Trump	And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out.	0
148	Donald Trump	I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting.	0
149	Donald Trump	It's all fake news.	0
150	Donald Trump	It's phony stuff.	0
151	Donald Trump	It didn't happen.	0
152	Donald Trump	And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people.	0
153	Donald Trump	It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.	0
154	Donald Trump	So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it.	0
155	Donald Trump	It should have never been -- number one, shouldn't have even entered paper.	0
156	Donald Trump	But it should have never have been released.	0
157	Donald Trump	But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace.	0
158	Donald Trump	I think it's an absolute disgrace.	0
159	Donald Trump	As far as hacking, I think it was Russia.	0
160	Donald Trump	But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.	0
161	Donald Trump	And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that.	0
162	Donald Trump	That was something that was extraordinary.	0
163	Donald Trump	That was probably China.	0
164	Donald Trump	We had -- we had much hacking going on.	0
165	Donald Trump	And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled.	0
166	Donald Trump	You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group.	0
167	Donald Trump	And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense.	0
168	Donald Trump	And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked.	0
169	Donald Trump	They did a very poor job.	0
170	Donald Trump	They could've had hacking defense, which we had.	0
171	Donald Trump	And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.	0
172	Donald Trump	And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.	1
173	Donald Trump	We have to do that for our country.	0
174	Donald Trump	It's very important.	0
175	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
176	Reporter	... just to the last part of that question how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin?	0
177	Donald Trump	Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news.	0
178	Donald Trump	They said it totally never happened.	0
179	Donald Trump	Now, somebody would say, "Oh, of course he's gonna say that."	0
180	Donald Trump	I respected the fact that he said that.	0
181	Donald Trump	And I -- I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it.	0
182	Donald Trump	I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her.	0
183	Donald Trump	I mean what he said about her was horrible.	0
184	Donald Trump	If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person.	0
185	Donald Trump	Because what he said about her was horrible.	0
186	Donald Trump	But remember this	0
187	Donald Trump	That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it?	0
188	Donald Trump	That's a horrible thing.	0
189	Donald Trump	That's a horrible thing.	0
190	Donald Trump	Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories.	0
191	Donald Trump	And they would've said immediately, "You have to get out of the race."	0
192	Donald Trump	Nobody even talked about it.	0
193	Donald Trump	It's a very terrible thing.	0
194	Donald Trump	Yeah?	0
195	Reporter	Can I ask you a question, sir?	0
196	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
197	Reporter	Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	0
198	Reporter	On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.	0
199	Reporter	Do you accept that part of the finding?	0
200	Reporter	And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?	0
201	Donald Trump	Well, if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia.	0
202	Donald Trump	Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky.	0
203	Donald Trump	I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time.	1
204	Donald Trump	The void was created, ISIS was formed.	0
205	Donald Trump	If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks?	0
206	Donald Trump	That's called an asset, not a liability.	0
207	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin.	0
208	Donald Trump	I hope I do.	0
209	Donald Trump	But there's a good chance I won't.	0
210	Donald Trump	And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?	0
211	Donald Trump	Does anybody in this room really believe that?	0
212	Donald Trump	Give me a break.	0
213	Donald Trump	OK?	0
214	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
215	Donald Trump	... President Obama...	0
216	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
217	Donald Trump	... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable...	0
218	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
219	Reporter	Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies?	0
220	Donald Trump	Lemme just tell you what I do.	0
221	Donald Trump	When I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say?	0
222	Donald Trump	I am extremely careful.	0
223	Donald Trump	I'm surrounded by bodyguards.	0
224	Donald Trump	I'm surrounded by people.	0
225	Donald Trump	And I always tell them -- anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, "Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras."	0
226	Donald Trump	I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.	0
227	Donald Trump	And number one, "I hope you're gonna be good anyway.	0
228	Donald Trump	But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.	0
229	Donald Trump	Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.	0
230	Donald Trump	You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television."	0
231	Donald Trump	I tell this to people all the time.	0
232	Donald Trump	I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well -- Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.	0
233	Donald Trump	And I told many people, "Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television.	0
234	Donald Trump	Cameras all over the place."	0
235	Donald Trump	And again, not just Russia, all over.	0
236	Donald Trump	Does anyone really believe that story?	0
237	Donald Trump	I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.	0
238	SYSTEM	[LAUGHTER]	0
239	Donald Trump	LaughterCrosstalk]	0
240	Reporter	... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business.	0
241	Reporter	But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks.	0
242	Reporter	Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified?	0
243	Reporter	Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise?	0
244	Reporter	And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?	0
245	Donald Trump	So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia.	0
246	Donald Trump	I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away.	0
247	Donald Trump	And I have no loans with Russia.	0
248	Donald Trump	As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt.	0
249	Donald Trump	I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt -- I have very low debt.	0
250	Donald Trump	But I have no loans with Russia at all.	0
251	Donald Trump	And I thought that was important to put out.	0
252	Donald Trump	I certified that.	0
253	Donald Trump	So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings.	0
254	Donald Trump	We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict.	0
255	Donald Trump	So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.	0
256	Donald Trump	Now, I have to say one other thing.	0
257	Donald Trump	Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy.	0
258	Donald Trump	And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it down.	0
259	Donald Trump	I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is -- I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have.	1
260	Donald Trump	But I don't want to take advantage of something.	0
261	Donald Trump	I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it.	0
262	Donald Trump	I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it.	0
263	Donald Trump	But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president.	0
264	Donald Trump	It was many, many years old, this is for presidents.	0
265	Donald Trump	Because they don't want presidents getting -- I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country.	0
266	Donald Trump	So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.	1
267	Donald Trump	I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.	0
268	Donald Trump	I would be the only one to be able to do that.	0
269	Donald Trump	You can't do that in any other capacity.	0
270	Donald Trump	But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company -- the country.	1
271	Donald Trump	I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.	0
272	Donald Trump	Now, all of these papers that you see here -- yes, go ahead.	0
273	Reporter	...do you believe the hacking was justified?	0
274	Reporter	And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia?	0
275	Donald Trump	I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit.	0
276	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
277	Reporter	But every president since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...	1
278	Donald Trump	You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK?	1
279	Donald Trump	They're the only who ask.	0
280	Reporter	You don't think the American public is concerned about it?	0
281	Donald Trump	No I don't think so.	0
282	Donald Trump	I won, when I became president.	0
283	Donald Trump	No, I don't think they care at all.	0
284	Donald Trump	I don't think they care at all.	0
285	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
286	Donald Trump	I think you care -- I think you care.	0
287	Donald Trump	First of all, you learn very little to a tax return.	1
288	Donald Trump	What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.	0
289	Donald Trump	And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought.	0
290	Donald Trump	We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it.	0
291	Donald Trump	And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company.	0
292	Donald Trump	They are going to be running it in a very professional manner.	0
293	Donald Trump	They're not going to discuss it with me.	0
294	Donald Trump	Again, I don't have to do this.	0
295	Donald Trump	They're not going to discuss it with me.	0
296	Donald Trump	And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.	0
297	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
298	Sheri Dillon	Good morning.	0
299	Sheri Dillon	It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request.	0
300	Sheri Dillon	He's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking.	0
301	Sheri Dillon	As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president.	0
302	Sheri Dillon	But at that time, no one was so concerned.	0
303	Sheri Dillon	President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own.	0
304	Sheri Dillon	To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.	0
305	Sheri Dillon	He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.	0
306	Sheri Dillon	As he said, he's voluntarily taking this on.	0
307	Sheri Dillon	The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets.	0
308	Sheri Dillon	The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms.	0
309	Sheri Dillon	And this is not just our interpretation.	0
310	Sheri Dillon	It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.	0
311	Sheri Dillon	Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests.	0
312	Sheri Dillon	He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit.	0
313	Sheri Dillon	He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.	0
314	Sheri Dillon	Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him.	0
315	Sheri Dillon	He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W.	0
316	Sheri Dillon	Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.	0
317	Sheri Dillon	Mr.	0
318	Sheri Dillon	Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan.	0
319	Sheri Dillon	He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.	0
320	Sheri Dillon	I'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking.	0
321	Sheri Dillon	First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the -- as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th.	0
322	Sheri Dillon	Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions.	0
323	Sheri Dillon	Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg.	0
324	Sheri Dillon	Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.	0
325	Sheri Dillon	Further, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team.	0
326	Sheri Dillon	The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.	0
327	Sheri Dillon	President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.	0
328	Sheri Dillon	President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.	0
329	Sheri Dillon	Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization.	0
330	Sheri Dillon	As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.	0
331	Sheri Dillon	The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments.	0
332	Sheri Dillon	As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets.	0
333	Sheri Dillon	Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.	0
334	Sheri Dillon	Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with.	0
335	Sheri Dillon	Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods.	0
336	Sheri Dillon	Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a--Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.	0
337	Sheri Dillon	Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated.	0
338	Sheri Dillon	This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016.	0
339	Sheri Dillon	As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.	0
340	Sheri Dillon	The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals.	0
341	Sheri Dillon	No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency.	0
342	Sheri Dillon	New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.	0
343	Sheri Dillon	The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV.	0
344	Sheri Dillon	Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.	0
345	Sheri Dillon	The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts.	0
346	Sheri Dillon	Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.	0
347	Sheri Dillon	To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights.	0
348	Sheri Dillon	Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole.	0
349	Sheri Dillon	There will be no separate business by business accounting.	0
350	Sheri Dillon	Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.	0
351	Sheri Dillon	He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.	0
352	Sheri Dillon	In sum, all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization.	0
353	Sheri Dillon	Some have asked questions.	0
354	Sheri Dillon	Why not divest?	0
355	Sheri Dillon	Why not just sell everything?	0
356	Sheri Dillon	Form of blind trust.	0
357	Sheri Dillon	And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.	0
358	Sheri Dillon	Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest.	0
359	Sheri Dillon	In fact, it would exacerbate them.	0
360	Sheri Dillon	The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets.	0
361	Sheri Dillon	If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.	0
362	Sheri Dillon	Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny.	0
363	Sheri Dillon	Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect.	0
364	Sheri Dillon	And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.	0
365	Sheri Dillon	President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.	0
366	Sheri Dillon	This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible.	0
367	Sheri Dillon	Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children.	0
368	Sheri Dillon	This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated.	0
369	Sheri Dillon	And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.	0
370	Sheri Dillon	Some people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company.	0
371	Sheri Dillon	Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter.	0
372	Sheri Dillon	It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.	0
373	Sheri Dillon	Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses.	0
374	Sheri Dillon	President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON	0
375	Sheri Dillon	I'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments.	0
376	Sheri Dillon	That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.	0
377	Sheri Dillon	And we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.	0
378	Sheri Dillon	Emoluments comes from the Constitution.	0
379	Sheri Dillon	The Constitution says "officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office."	0
380	Sheri Dillon	The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.	0
381	Sheri Dillon	No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument.	0
382	Sheri Dillon	Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.	0
383	Sheri Dillon	But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms.	0
384	Sheri Dillon	They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of.	0
385	Sheri Dillon	These people are wrong.	0
386	Sheri Dillon	This is not what the Constitution says.	0
387	Sheri Dillon	Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office.	1
388	Sheri Dillon	It's not an emolument.	1
389	Sheri Dillon	The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here.	0
390	Sheri Dillon	But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.	0
391	Sheri Dillon	So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury.	0
392	Sheri Dillon	This way, it is the American people who will profit.	0
393	Sheri Dillon	In sum, I and president-elect's other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.	0
394	Sheri Dillon	We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.	0
395	Sheri Dillon	The American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted.	0
396	Sheri Dillon	Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.	0
397	Sheri Dillon	President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans.	0

413	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
414	Donald Trump	I -- I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in -- I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson.	0
415	Donald Trump	I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying.	0
416	Donald Trump	I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general.	0
417	Donald Trump	And he was brilliant.	0
418	Donald Trump	And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama.	0
419	Donald Trump	And he was brilliant yesterday.	0
420	Donald Trump	So, I really think that they are -- I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together.	0
421	Donald Trump	And we've been hearing that from so many people.	0
422	Donald Trump	People are so happy.	0
423	Donald Trump	You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil.	0
424	Donald Trump	When there was a find, he would get it.	0
425	Donald Trump	When they needed something, he would be there.	0
426	Donald Trump	A friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.	0
427	Donald Trump	And that's what we want.	0
428	Donald Trump	That's what I want to bring to government.	0
429	Donald Trump	I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind.	0
430	Donald Trump	We don't make good deals any more.	0
431	Donald Trump	I say it all the time in speeches.	0
432	Donald Trump	We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals.	0
433	Donald Trump	Our trade deals are a disaster.	0
434	Donald Trump	So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart.	0
435	Donald Trump	And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well.	0
436	Donald Trump	It's very interesting how it's going, but it's -- I think they're doing very, very well.	0

439	Reporter	Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	0
440	Reporter	I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare?	0
441	Donald Trump	Yeah. Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or...	0
442	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
443	Donald Trump	Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked.	0
444	Reporter	...though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law?	0
445	Donald Trump	You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care.	0
446	Donald Trump	Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.	0
447	Donald Trump	They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you.	0
448	Donald Trump	In some cases, they guide you incorrectly.	0
449	Donald Trump	In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit.	0
450	Donald Trump	Some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year.	1
451	Donald Trump	It's going to be catastrophic.	0
452	Donald Trump	Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.	0
453	Donald Trump	We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare.	0
454	Donald Trump	We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically.	0
455	Donald Trump	They own it right now.	0
456	Donald Trump	So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.	0
457	Donald Trump	We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.	0
458	Donald Trump	It'll be repeal and replace.	0
459	Donald Trump	It will be essentially, simultaneously.	0
460	Donald Trump	It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.	0
461	Donald Trump	So we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff.	0
462	Donald Trump	And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country.	0
463	Donald Trump	You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.	0
464	Donald Trump	Obamacare is the Democrats problem.	0
465	Donald Trump	We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.	0
466	Donald Trump	We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it.	0
467	Donald Trump	We could sit back and let them hang with it.	0
468	Donald Trump	We are doing the Democrats a great service.	0
469	Donald Trump	So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan.	0
470	Donald Trump	And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times.	0
471	Donald Trump	And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
472	Donald Trump	We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.	0

477	Donald Trump	I was going right here.	0
478	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
479	Reporter	President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg from Cheddar.	0
480	Reporter	When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce?	0
481	Reporter	And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?	0
482	Donald Trump	Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier.	0
483	Donald Trump	And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.	1
484	Donald Trump	And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot.	0
485	Donald Trump	But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.	0
486	Donald Trump	You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we don't even have a border.	0
487	Donald Trump	It's an open sieve.	0
488	Donald Trump	But you're going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen.	0
489	Donald Trump	You're going to pay a very large border tax.	0
490	Donald Trump	So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina.	0
491	Donald Trump	You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.	0
492	Donald Trump	You can do anywhere -- you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition.	0
493	Donald Trump	So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away.	0
494	Donald Trump	You've got a lot of places you can move.	0
495	Donald Trump	And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States.	0
496	Donald Trump	There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.	0
497	Donald Trump	And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago.	0
498	Donald Trump	And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get.	1
499	Donald Trump	You know that story.	0

528	Donald Trump	Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall.	0

540	Donald Trump	And they will scream out, "Mexico."	0
541	Donald Trump	Now, reports went out last week -- oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement.	0
542	Donald Trump	What's the difference?	0
543	Donald Trump	I want to get the wall started.	0
544	Donald Trump	I don't want to wait a year-and-a--half until I make my deal with Mexico.	0
545	Donald Trump	And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.	0
546	Donald Trump	And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice.	0
547	Donald Trump	I respect the government of Mexico.	0
548	Donald Trump	I respect the people of Mexico.	0
549	Donald Trump	I love the people of Mexico.	0
550	Donald Trump	I have many people from Mexico working for me.	0
551	Donald Trump	They're phenomenal people.	0
552	Donald Trump	The government of Mexico is terrific.	0
553	Donald Trump	I don't blame them for what's happened.	0
554	Donald Trump	I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States.	0
555	Donald Trump	I wish our politicians were so smart.	0
556	Donald Trump	Mexico has taken advantage of the United States.	0
557	Donald Trump	I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico.	0
558	Donald Trump	What I say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
559	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen anymore.	0
560	Donald Trump	So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed.	0
561	Donald Trump	OK?	0
562	Donald Trump	Supreme Court judge.	0
563	Donald Trump	So, as you know, I have a list of 20.	0
564	Donald Trump	I've gone through them.	0
565	Donald Trump	We've met with numerous candidates.	0
566	Donald Trump	They're outstanding in every case.	0
567	Donald Trump	They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society.	0
568	Donald Trump	Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy.	0
569	Donald Trump	That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening.	0
570	Donald Trump	So our first day -- and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week.	0
571	Donald Trump	And you're all invited.	0
572	Donald Trump	But on the Supreme Court, I'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in.	0
573	Donald Trump	I think it's one of the reasons I got elected.	0
574	Donald Trump	I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.	0
575	Reporter	The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there?	0
576	Reporter	What are you trying to tell the American public?	0
577	Donald Trump	I think it was disgraceful -- disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out.	0
578	Donald Trump	I think it's a disgrace, and I say that -- and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.	0
579	Donald Trump	I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.	0
580	Donald Trump	As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences.	0
581	Donald Trump	They already are.	0
582	Donald Trump	And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up -- and by the way, we just found out I was coming down.	0
583	Donald Trump	Michael Cohen -- I was being -- Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer.	0
584	Donald Trump	He's a good lawyer in my firm.	0
585	Donald Trump	It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohen they we're talking about.	0
586	Donald Trump	So all night long it's Michael Cohen.	0
587	Donald Trump	I said, "I want to see your passport."	0
588	Donald Trump	He brings his passport to my office.	0
589	Donald Trump	I say, hey, wait a minute.	0
590	Donald Trump	He didn't leave the country.	0
591	Donald Trump	He wasn't out of the country.	0
592	Donald Trump	They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague.	0
593	Donald Trump	It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen.	0
594	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace what took place.	0
595	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.	0

625	Donald Trump	Plans to send me a bill for what?	0
626	Reporter	Tougher sanctions.	0
627	Donald Trump	I hadn't heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that.	0
628	Donald Trump	Lindsey Graham.	0
629	Donald Trump	I've been competing with him for a long time.	0
630	Donald Trump	He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day.	0
631	Donald Trump	I didn't realize Lindsey Graham still had it.	0
632	Donald Trump	That's all right.	0

640	Reporter	From BBC news.	0
641	Reporter	Ian Pannell from BBC news.	0
642	Donald Trump	BBC news.	0
643	Donald Trump	That's another beauty.	0
644	Reporter	Thank you.	0
645	Reporter	Thank you.	0
646	Reporter	As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it.	0
647	Reporter	If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...	0
648	Donald Trump	There's nothing they could come back with.	0
649	Reporter	Can you...	0
650	Donald Trump	Go ahead.	0
651	Reporter	...published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here?	0
652	Donald Trump	Well, I don't recommend reforms.	0
653	Donald Trump	I recommend people that are -- that have some moral compass.	0
654	Donald Trump	You know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things.	0
655	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody.	0
656	Donald Trump	I could name them, but I won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us.	0
657	Donald Trump	They're very, very dishonest people, but I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.	0
658	Donald Trump	Yes?	0
659	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
660	Reporter	I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community.	0
661	Reporter	And be very clear about what you're saying.	0
662	Reporter	Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials?	0
663	Reporter	And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?	0
664	Donald Trump	Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important.	0
665	Donald Trump	We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats.	0
666	Donald Trump	We're going to be putting in some outstanding people.	0
667	Donald Trump	Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.	0
668	Donald Trump	I want them to cover this situation.	0
669	Donald Trump	I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly -- because we're hacked by everybody -- you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection.	0
670	Donald Trump	If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in the category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense.	0
671	Donald Trump	Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.	0
672	Donald Trump	That's why we weren't hacked.	0
673	Donald Trump	By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack.	0
674	Donald Trump	And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.	0
675	Donald Trump	The Democratic National Committee didn't do that.	0
676	Donald Trump	Maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way.	0
677	Donald Trump	But I will tell you -- wait -- wait -- wait, let me finish.	0
678	Donald Trump	Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena -- fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.	0
679	Donald Trump	That includes Russia and China and everybody -- everybody. OK.	0
680	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
681	Donald Trump	Go ahead -- go ahead.	0
682	Reporter	Mr. President-elect, you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta's e-mails, et cetera.	0
683	Donald Trump	All right, but you know what, it could have been others also.	0
684	Reporter	But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?	0
685	Donald Trump	Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.	0
686	Donald Trump	I think it's pretty sad.	0
687	Donald Trump	First of all, it's illegal.	0
688	Donald Trump	You know, these are -- these are classified and certified meetings and reports.	0
689	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what does happen.	0
690	Donald Trump	I have many meetings with intelligence.	0
691	Donald Trump	And every time I meet, people are reading about it.	0
692	Donald Trump	Somebody's leaking it out.	0
693	Donald Trump	So, there's -- maybe it's my office.	0
694	Donald Trump	Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people.	0
695	Donald Trump	Maybe it's them.	0
696	Donald Trump	And what I did is I said I won't tell anybody.	0
697	Donald Trump	I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.	0
698	Donald Trump	And what happened is I had my meeting.	0
699	Donald Trump	Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know -- I didn't tell her.	0
700	Donald Trump	Nobody knew.	0
701	Donald Trump	The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left.	0
702	Donald Trump	And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.	0
703	Donald Trump	So, I don't want that -- I don't want that.	0
704	Donald Trump	It's very unfair to the country.	0
705	Donald Trump	It's very unfair to our country; what's happened.	0
706	Donald Trump	That report should have never -- first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on.	0
707	Donald Trump	And I thank the New York Times for saying that.	0
708	Donald Trump	I thank a lot of different people for saying that.	0
709	Donald Trump	But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.	0
710	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]	0
711	Reporter	Thank you, Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign.	0
712	Reporter	And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now?	0
713	Donald Trump	He shouldn't be doing it.	0
714	Donald Trump	He won't be doing it.	0
715	Donald Trump	Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it.	0
716	Donald Trump	You will see that.	0
717	Donald Trump	Russia will respect our country more.	0
718	Donald Trump	He shouldn't have done it.	0
719	Donald Trump	I don't believe that he will be doing it more now.	0
720	Donald Trump	We have to work something out, but it's not just Russia.	0
721	Donald Trump	Take a look at what's happened.	0
722	Donald Trump	You don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China.	0
723	Donald Trump	And that's because we have no defense.	0
724	Donald Trump	That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing.	0
725	Donald Trump	But Russia and other countries -- and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total.	0
726	Donald Trump	Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.	0
727	Donald Trump	I want to thank everybody.	0
728	Donald Trump	So this is all -- just so you understand, these papers -- because I'm not sure that was explained properly.	0
729	Donald Trump	But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job.	0
730	Donald Trump	Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, "You're fired."	0
731	Donald Trump	Good-bye, everybody.	0
732	Donald Trump	Good-bye.	0
