1	COOPER	And welcome back.	0
2	COOPER	There is history all around us here at downtown Milwaukee’s Riverside Theater, which opened in 1928.	0
3	COOPER	It was nearly destroyed by fire in 1966.	0
4	COOPER	It was lovingly restored in the 80s and has been at the heart of this city’s cultural life ever since.	0
5	COOPER	It is a magnificent theater.	0
6	COOPER	We’re here in the mid of a history-making Republican presidential campaign, bringing voters face to face with the candidates, showcasing their questions and bringing it all to you at home.	0
7	COOPER	Joining us now is Ohio’s governor, John Kasich.	0
8	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
9	KASICH	How are you?	0
10	COOPER	Good to see you.	0
11	COOPER	Have a seat.	0
12	COOPER	All right, we got a lot of questions from the audience about a lot of policy issues.	0
13	COOPER	A couple of questions on news of the day.	0
14	COOPER	Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, charged today with simple battery.	0
15	COOPER	Would you fire him?	0
16	KASICH	Well, I haven’t seen the video, but they tell me the video is real.	0
17	KASICH	Of course I would.	0
18	KASICH	Look, when you have problems like that, you have to act.	0
19	KASICH	Now, I’ve been of course an executive running the seventh-largest state.	0
20	KASICH	And we see things that happen.	0
21	KASICH	At times, you want to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when you see things that are pretty clear – from what I understand the video is clear.	0
22	KASICH	Of course would fire him.	0
23	COOPER	Let’s talk about your path to the nomination.	0
24	COOPER	You are pinning your hopes on a contested convention.	0
25	COOPER	Assuming there is one, why would you be selected?	0
26	COOPER	You’ve only won one state, your home state, Ohio.	0
27	COOPER	Why would you get the nomination?	0
28	KASICH	Well, a couple of reasons, Anderson.	0
29	KASICH	First of all, in virtually every national poll, I am the only one that beats Hillary Clinton consistently.	1
30	KASICH	In fact, in the last poll that came out I was up 11 points.	0
31	KASICH	Secondly, and, you know, delegates would look, for example, at, you know, can you win in the fall?	0
32	KASICH	I mean, it’s like a really important part of this thing, it’s not just the nomination, it’s about winning the election.	0
33	KASICH	And frankly, if we do not have a strong candidate that brings people together, we have a prospect of losing the United States Senate as well.	0
34	KASICH	And secondly, Anderson, at some point that people that go to a convention are going to be concerned about who actually could run the country.	0
35	KASICH	I mean, it’s like a big deal.	0
36	KASICH	You know, who could be president, who could be commander-in-chief?	0
37	KASICH	And I have more experience than really all of them put together except for Mrs. Clinton.	0
38	KASICH	I mean, I have — you know, I served 18 years on the defense — Armed Services Committee, I was in the Pentagon after 9/11.	0
39	KASICH	I was chairman of the Budget Committee.	0
40	KASICH	I was involved in welfare reform.	0
41	KASICH	When I was chairman of the Budget Committee, we balanced the budget, we had job growth.	0
42	KASICH	I’ve been the executive in Ohio.	0
43	KASICH	We’ve grown jobs.	0
44	KASICH	So at some point people are going to look at two things, who can win in the fall, and secondly who could be the best president?	0
45	COOPER	But polls are one thing, though, I mean, to have only won — if it continues on this path, to have only won one state, your home state, won’t some delegates say, look, OK, the polls say he can win in a head-to-head matchup against Hillary Clinton, but the voters have spoken.	0
46	KASICH	Well, Anderson, I think it’s pretty clear and most of the people in here I think would agree with this, for most of the debates, I was completely ignored.	0
47	KASICH	I mean, it has been like the last three weeks to a month that people have started to pay attention to who I am and my message.	0
48	KASICH	And it has fundamentally happened that way because I’ve not gotten down in the mud.	0
49	KASICH	I haven’t name-called.	0
50	KASICH	I haven’t had all these nasty sound bites.	0
51	KASICH	I’ve just been laying out my record and my vision for what I want to see happen.	0
52	KASICH	But conventions are very interesting.	0
53	KASICH	Republicans have had 10 conventions.	0
54	KASICH	And the leader going into the convention has only been the nominee three times out of 10.	0
55	KASICH	Seven times out of 10 they were not.	0
56	KASICH	So I think — and we’re going to do better as this calendar moves to the east.	0
57	KASICH	Look, now I’m starting to get on my home court, you know, — look, I went to Ohio, I won by 11 points.	0
58	KASICH	You know, I did very, well there.	0
59	KASICH	We’re going to go to Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.	0
60	KASICH	These are all places where I can do extremely well.	0
61	KASICH	And we will continue to accumulate delegates.	0
62	KASICH	And we’ll have momentum going into the convention.	0
63	KASICH	And by the way, the convention is nothing more than an extension of the process we have going now.	0
64	KASICH	Somehow people think they’re truncated somehow, they’re disjointed.	0
65	KASICH	They’re not.	0
66	KASICH	It’s a process of primaries.	0
67	KASICH	You accumulate delegates.	0
68	KASICH	You go to the convention.	0
69	KASICH	And then they pick the nominees.	0
70	COOPER	I want to ask you about terrorism.	0
71	COOPER	When you were asked about what happened in Brussels last week — or let’s talk about that.	0
72	COOPER	In terms of what U.S. response should and what the fight against ISIS should look like, you said yesterday that one of the opponents wants to make the sand glow and the other one complains about other countries not doing enough, obviously you were talking about Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump.	0
73	COOPER	Why would America be safer under your watch?	0
74	KASICH	Well, Anderson, first of all, I’ve been saying for a long time and laid out an extensive program on rebuilding the military.	0
75	KASICH	Secondly, I’ve been the one arguing all along that we need to go after ISIS in a coalition like we had in the first Gulf War.	0
76	KASICH	I was there when I saw it happen.	0
77	KASICH	I saw our Muslim Arab friends join us in the West, and we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait.	0
78	KASICH	You know, secondly, that same coalition needs come together and we need to destroy ISIS both in the air and on the ground, settle it down and then come home.	0
79	KASICH	And let the regional powers draw the map.	0
80	COOPER	There are a lot of countries, Saudi Arabia, that don’t necessarily see ISIS as their predominant threat.	0
81	KASICH	Oh, no, no, no.	0
82	KASICH	Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, they all know it’s an existential threat.	0
83	KASICH	They know that they — that the kingdom hangs by a thread because of the radicalism of ISIS.	0
84	KASICH	And so the fact is they will join us.	0
85	KASICH	They joined us before against Saddam Hussein.	0
86	KASICH	That was not as big of a deal as this is where they’re blowing people up all over the world.	0
87	KASICH	Secondly, of course, I think, Anderson, that we need really good worldwide intelligence.	0
88	KASICH	I think that the lemons we’re seeing can be turned into lemonade and I think a president of the United States can rally the civilized world to destroy these folks who are intent on destroying us.	0
89	KASICH	And secondly, we talked about NATO.	0
90	KASICH	That was another thing I talked about.	0
91	KASICH	We need to change NATO from not just a military organization, but an intelligence-gathering and also a policing organization that works across boundaries.	0
92	KASICH	All of us together, fighting together, working together, destroy ISIS, have the good human intelligence…	0
93	COOPER	Donald Trump says NATO is obsolete.	0
94	COOPER	Is it?	0
95	KASICH	Well, of course it’s not.	0
96	KASICH	That’s absurd, obsolete, OK?	0
97	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
98	KASICH	Now, look, it’s really important that we get these countries to pitch in and do more.	0
99	KASICH	They’ll never do as much as we want.	0
100	KASICH	I mean, I lived through a whole time when we would push them, pressure them.	0
101	KASICH	Part of the problem is it’s their governments over there.	0
102	KASICH	You know, there is too much socialism, there is too much political correctness.	0
103	KASICH	That’s why they didn’t even catch this thing in Brussels.	0
104	KASICH	And you know that the screw-ups that we saw with the intelligence.	0
105	KASICH	But here’s the thing: no, NATO has an additional role now.	0
106	KASICH	And that is policing and intelligence gathering.	0
107	KASICH	You see, we need to have the Muslims working with us and the West —	0
108	COOPER	That’s critical?	0
109	KASICH	Absolutely critical.	0
110	KASICH	Let me tell you, Anderson, if we wanted to get information out of some radical that’s in a mosque — you’re a really great guy, but if you were three blocks from the mosque, do you think you’d get anything?	0
111	COOPER	I don’t blend very well.	0
112	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
113	KASICH	No, you are don’t.	0
114	KASICH	Well, the fact is is that we want the Muslims who are — they feel as strongly as we do about these murderers out there.	0
115	KASICH	These Muslims, they’re the ones that have to police their own neighborhoods.	0
116	KASICH	And, frankly, we need the imams to come out and issue statements about how their religion has been hijacked.	0
117	KASICH	But it takes all of us together.	0
118	KASICH	It takes us to have great human intelligence.	0
119	KASICH	And here in the United States we’ve got counterterrorism task forces made up of the FBI, it’s made up of Homeland Security, state and local law enforcement, and their job is to disrupt.	0
120	KASICH	That’s why the issue of Apple was so important because they need the resources to be able to carry out their job for all of us, but they need one other thing: they need the tools.	0
121	KASICH	And if they can’t hear, then it becomes a problem.	0
122	KASICH	But there’s also a role for us.	0
123	KASICH	Because when we see something happening in our neighborhood, Anderson, we have an obligation to alert authorities as well.	0
124	COOPER	You talked about Donald Trump belittle — in an interview today, you said about Donald Trump’s foreign, “I think that’s the most ridiculous of foreign policy I ever heard.	0
125	COOPER	This is just somebody that just doesn’t understand foreign policy.	0
126	COOPER	Just doesn’t” —	0
127	KASICH	Well which part was I talking about?	0
128	KASICH	I don’t remember.	0
129	COOPER	I’m not sure either.	0
130	KASICH	OK. Well, I mean, I think the idea that – I’ll tell you one.	0
131	COOPER	Do you think he –	0
132	KASICH	We’re going to have a religious test on who comes in the country.	0
133	KASICH	So, when you come in the country, I say, well, are you a Muslim?	0
134	KASICH	Raise your hand if you’re a Muslim.	0
135	KASICH	I mean, come on, Anderson.	0
136	KASICH	That’s not going to work.	0
137	KASICH	We’re not going to police Muslim neighborhoods.	0
138	KASICH	We can’t afford polarization of people who are in the civilized world.	0
139	KASICH	You know, there are people all over the world that know that this threat has to be stopped.	0
140	KASICH	It has to be destroyed, and we have to work together as a world.	0
141	KASICH	Because when people in Pakistan die, we all die a little bit when they blow up innocent men, women and children at an Easter service.	0
142	KASICH	I mean, the world understands this.	0
143	KASICH	And this is an opportunity for us to be brought together.	0
144	KASICH	The president, by the way, went to a baseball game in Cuba instead of coming home, meeting.	0
145	KASICH	I’ll tell you what I would do if I were president.	0
146	KASICH	I would come home, I would call world leaders.	0
147	KASICH	I would gather my military and intelligence experts.	0
148	KASICH	I would find out our vulnerabilities, and I would send them to Europe.	0
149	KASICH	And I would say, let us look at what our problems are, and let’s fix them immediately.	0
150	COOPER	The response of the White House is often to that criticism –	0
151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
152	COOPER	The response of the White House to that criticism, and I want you to be able to respond to it, is often, well, look.	0
153	COOPER	By changing the president’s schedule, it gives power to the terrorist group that they’re able to change the leader of the free world’ s schedule and that he can do the work he needs to do on wherever location he’s at.	0
154	KASICH	So you kind of go to a baseball game, and you don’t come home?	0
155	COOPER	Well, that’s another issue.	0
156	KASICH	And – no, here’s the situation.	0
157	KASICH	That attack was in the heart of Europe.	0
158	KASICH	I mean, that was an attack on the very heart of our friends who live in Europe.	0
159	KASICH	Yes, I think it’s important enough to come home.	0
160	KASICH	Secondly  —	0
161	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
162	KASICH	— I’ll give you another one that I can’t believe.	0
163	KASICH	The president of the United States — the first thing he did is he wouldn’t meet with our friend Netanyahu.	0
164	KASICH	OK, that was the first meeting he snubbed.	0
165	KASICH	Now, he’s snubbed another one.	0
166	KASICH	He’s snubbed a meeting with the president of Turkey.	0
167	KASICH	Do you know how important it is for to us have good relations with Turkey?	0
168	KASICH	They’re the gateway to the East.	0
169	KASICH	Now, Erdogan is doing some things that none of us like.	0
170	KASICH	But you know what?	0
171	KASICH	We have to deal with him.	0
172	KASICH	He is the one that alerted the Europeans about the radical that was moving over to Brussels.	0
173	KASICH	You have to be able to manage this.	0
174	KASICH	And I tell you, it’s complicated, it takes sophistication.	0
175	KASICH	And you need to have good advisers.	0
176	KASICH	But I’ll tell you what else you need.	0
177	KASICH	You need experience, and you need a good gut.	0
178	KASICH	And I’ve been involved in these things for almost all of my adult lifetime.	0
179	KASICH	So, I have advisers, but I don’t have many teachers.	0
180	KASICH	I understand most of these things.	0
181	COOPER	We’ve talked about Trump’s campaign manager.	0
182	COOPER	Your campaign manager tweeted this just a couple of hours ago.	0
183	COOPER	Quote, “Cruz with zero friends, zero record, zero vision, zero chance decides to lie about @JohnKasich.	0
184	COOPER	Desperate?	0
185	COOPER	Trump right on one thing, “lying Ted.”	0
186	COOPER	Does this signal any kind of a new phase –	0
187	KASICH	No, I didn’t know he – you know, because sometimes he gets a little tweet happy, and I don’t like that, OK?	0
188	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
189	KASICH	And I will have a word with him about it.	0
190	KASICH	But let me say – that look.	0
191	KASICH	The Cruz campaign, their super PAC is spending a half a billion (sic) to $800,000 against me in Wisconsin.	0
192	KASICH	I mean, they say, well, Kasich doesn’t have any strength out here.	0
193	KASICH	Usually, if you don’t have any strength, they don’t spend $500,000 to $800,000 attacking you.	0
194	KASICH	And you know, the attacks are – look.	0
195	KASICH	Arnold Schwarzenegger told me in 2010 when I was running for governor, I was saying, Arnold, they’re really beating me up.	0
196	KASICH	He looked at me and said, “John, love the beatings.”  Okay, that’s part of politics, and I’ve learned to love the beatings.	0
197	KASICH	But I mean, the fact is, is that they are hammering me, and they’re not hammering Trump.	0
198	KASICH	It’s very interesting.	0
199	KASICH	But that’s okay; I can take it.	0
200	COOPER	In terms of tone and tenor of the campaign, your two fellow candidates have obviously been duking it out over the last week or so…	0
201	KASICH	The last week or so?	0
202	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
203	KASICH	How about the last five months?	0
204	KASICH	Where you been, Anderson?	0
205	COOPER	In this new phase on the whole…	0
206	KASICH	That’s why I’m not in the news.	0
207	KASICH	I didn’t call anybody a name.	0
208	KASICH	And you know what, I’m in the going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.	0
209	KASICH	I’m not going to do it.	0
210	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
211	COOPER	That’s my question.	0
212	COOPER	That was my question, which was, what does it look like from the sidelines when you watch this?	0
213	KASICH	I’ll tell you, sometimes it’s amazing to me.	0
214	KASICH	Sometimes when I look at it I think, what the heck are we doing here?	0
215	KASICH	You know, I was on a radio talk show with some guy here, Jay somebody or other, I don’t remember this morning — yes, whatever his name is.	0
216	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
217	KASICH	Nice guy.	0
218	KASICH	Nice guy.	0
219	KASICH	And he was — and even yesterday I was on a different one, and a guy says to me, well, you know, maybe this is the new politics.	0
220	KASICH	If name calling, bringing in spouses and ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics, we all need to stand against it.	0
221	KASICH	Our children are watching.	0
222	KASICH	This is America.	0
223	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
224	KASICH	We need to talk about what we’re for.	0
225	KASICH	And I have been consistent.	0
226	KASICH	Now, when they say something on policy-wise that’s bad, of course I’m going to say something about it, but I don’t want to go down into — I’m not going to go down there.	0
227	KASICH	I hope not.	0
228	KASICH	I could screw up but I hope not.	0
229	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
230	COOPER	Let’s go to our audience for some issues (ph).	0
231	COOPER	Jim Vogel (ph) is here.	0
232	COOPER	He works in advertising.	0
233	COOPER	He says he’s leaning right now towards Senator Cruz.	0
234	COOPER	Jim, welcome.	0
235	QUESTION	Hi, governor.	0
236	QUESTION	In Ohio you accepted Medicaid expansion and you took on the — I’m sorry, the health care exchanges and it was to help the poor.	0
237	QUESTION	Here in Wisconsin we used — Governor Walker used BadgerCare to essentially provide the same services at the same levels, and yet we did it without creating a whole new entitlement program and expanding federal debt.	0
238	QUESTION	Why did you choose Obamacare?	0
239	QUESTION	Why did you choose the Washington-based solution?	0
240	QUESTION	And why can’t you guys ever look at some other source other than Washington for these solutions?	0
241	KASICH	Okay, let me say a couple of things.	0
242	KASICH	First of all, it’s not so simple what Governor Walker did here.	0
243	KASICH	If you look at it, it’s more complicated.	0
244	KASICH	And by the way, today the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel endorsed me for president of the United States saying I’m the guy that is a pragmatic conservative that can get things done.	0
245	KASICH	I was really appreciative of that endorsement.	0
246	KASICH	But look, I took a Medicaid program that was growing at 10 1/2 percent, and in my second year as governor it grew at 2 1/2 percent, without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one benefit.	0
247	KASICH	How did I do it?	0
248	KASICH	I brought innovation to the system.	0
249	KASICH	Now I then had a choice.	0
250	KASICH	Now that my program was under control, I then had a choice.	0
251	KASICH	Could I bring money back, which is frankly our money, Ohio money, back to Ohio to solve some of our problems.	0
252	KASICH	Let me tell what you we’ve done.	0
253	KASICH	I don’t believe the mentally ill ought to be sleeping under a bridge or living in prison.	0
254	KASICH	It costs $22,500 a year to put them in prison.	0
255	KASICH	If I can get their medication and get them on their feet and if get they can get a job, they become taxpayers.	0
256	KASICH	We save money.	0
257	KASICH	Secondly, I believe that the drug addicted in our prisons should be treated, because we don’t want a revolving door of in and out of the prisons, because that costs $22,500 a year, and we also are throwing a life down the drain.	0
258	KASICH	So guess what, because of our program now in the prisons and with the community, we have an 80 percent success rate in not having people go back in, and our recidivism rate is 27 percent.	0
259	KASICH	And, by the way, we’re running a $2 billion surplus.	1
260	KASICH	We don’t put our budget together with scotch tap and bail and wire — we’re running a $2 million surplus.	0
261	KASICH	We’re managing it all.	0
262	KASICH	So where are we?	0
263	KASICH	Where we are in Ohio, is we are not treating the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, they’re in a better position, they’re not in our prisons, and at the same time, they’re getting on their feet, they’re becoming taxpayers and our Medicaid program is completely under control.	0
264	KASICH	And by the way, I reject Obamacare, and I did not go along with the exchange that they were trying to force on me, because I never knew what the heck was going to come of it.	0
265	KASICH	I actually have a solid health care plan to replace Obamacare, which involves transparency, competition, market-oriented forces.	0
266	KASICH	We’re actually doing it in my state, and I’d like to spread it all across the country.	0
267	KASICH	So the idea of doing that was not only compassionate, but it also made good economic sense for our state and it’s working out quite well.	0
268	COOPER	Thank you for your question.	0
269	COOPER	Governor, I want you too meet, this is Julie Grace.	0
270	COOPER	She’s a student at Marquette University…	0
271	KASICH	You know what, just one other thing I wanted to say.	0
272	KASICH	You understand that I spent 10 years of my life fighting to balance the budget.	0
273	KASICH	And we got it balanced.	0
274	KASICH	Senator Domenici and I worked with the Clinton administration.	0
275	KASICH	We got the budget balanced four years in a row.	0
276	KASICH	It hadn’t been balanced since man walked on the moon, hasn’t been balanced since.	0
277	KASICH	And when I left Washington, there was a $5 trillion surplus, and guess who spent it?	0
278	KASICH	The Republicans.	0
279	KASICH	Now, sir, you have to stand in the breach when you’re a leader.	0
280	KASICH	And what I did in Washington in getting that budget under control, and seeing it liftoff in jobs, and what I’ve done in Ohio, we’re now up 417,000 jobs in Ohio from a downturn of when I came in of 350,000.	0
281	KASICH	And we’ve cut taxes by more than any governor in the country, including your governor.	0
282	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
283	COOPER	All right.	0
284	COOPER	I want you to meet Julie Grace, she’s a student at Marquette University.	0
285	KASICH	But thank you.	0
286	COOPER	And she said she’s supporting you.	0
287	KASICH	Oh, you are?	0
288	QUESTION	I am.	0
289	KASICH	Good.	0
290	KASICH	OK.  Say something really, really good.	0
291	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
292	QUESTION	I’ll try.	0
293	QUESTION	So in Europe many far right conservative parties, anti-immigrant parties have been gaining momentum recently, specifically Germany, Sweden, France, and Britain.	0
294	QUESTION	Do you think a similar movement is occurring here in the U.S.?	0
295	QUESTION	And if so, how can the Republican Party address this?	0
296	KASICH	We’ve gone through periods of time in our history when we have turned against immigration.	0
297	KASICH	It has happened.	0
298	KASICH	And these movement have sprung up.	0
299	KASICH	Look, we have to — young lady, we have to protect the border.	0
300	KASICH	That is a given, OK?	0
301	KASICH	For a couple of reasons, and one of them is security.	0
302	KASICH	So we have to get the border done.	0
303	KASICH	And secondly, we should have a guest worker program where people can come in and work, and then they can go back home, because that’s what they want to do.	0
304	KASICH	And thirdly, if they came here illegally but they’ve not committed a crime since they’ve been here, they’ll pay a fine, back taxes, and they can have a path to legalization, not a path to citizenship.	0
305	KASICH	Now the idea that we’re going to drive around in Waukesha and we’re going to drive around here in Milwaukee, and we’re going to yank people out of their homes, leaving their kids on the front porch crying and screaming?	0
306	KASICH	Come on, that’s ridiculous, OK?	0
307	KASICH	Call it what it is, it’s ridiculous.	0
308	KASICH	But we can get the border fixed.	0
309	KASICH	We can have a guest worker program.	0
310	KASICH	We can get a path to legalization, not let anybody else come.	0
311	KASICH	You have got to go back, no excuses.	0
312	KASICH	And you want to know what I think?	0
313	KASICH	I think that can pass.	0
314	KASICH	I think that can pass the United States Congress.	0
315	KASICH	And I think it can pass with the American people and get this issue behind us and get this thing healed.	0
316	KASICH	We need a healing in America.	0
317	KASICH	And stop kicking cans down the road and solve problems in this country.	0
318	KASICH	And I think that’s a reasonable solution to this problem of immigration.	0

324	QUESTION	My question — the most recent terrorist attack in Brussels has highlighted a big issue we have with our attack on foreign terrorism.	0
325	QUESTION	That is, we now have neighborhoods that are being deemed as terrorist hotbeds.	0
326	QUESTION	Do you support Senator Cruz’s — when he says we should go into Muslim neighborhoods and patrol them?	0
327	KASICH	No, I don’t support that at all.	0
328	KASICH	I think it’s ridiculous.	0
329	KASICH	And you know what?	0
330	KASICH	The guy who was the best police guy in the whole country, he understands policing, is a guy named Bill Bratton.	0
331	KASICH	He’s now currently the police chief in New York.	0
332	KASICH	He was the police chief under Rudy Giuliani.	0
333	KASICH	He was the head of the metro system in Boston.	0
334	KASICH	And he ran the Los Angeles Police Department.	0
335	KASICH	He is absolutely the best.	0
336	KASICH	He said that plan is ridiculous.	0
337	KASICH	And let me just tell you, sir, we all want to catch these bad guys.	0
338	KASICH	And I know how it works because I’ve got Joint Terrorism Task Force members who are in my state, they’re in your state.	0
339	KASICH	We need to hear what’s happening in the community.	0
340	KASICH	So let me just — let me ask you this question.	0
341	KASICH	If all of a sudden we start trying to pinpoint you — we have a religious test, we’re going to now patrol your neighborhood and your home because we suspect,  even though you’re as law-abiding as anybody else in the country.	0
342	KASICH	Now I want you to help me find out who the bad guys are.	0
343	KASICH	I mean, come on, that doesn’t make any sense that if we polarize the entire Muslim community, how are we going to get the information we want?	0
344	KASICH	We want Muslims who go to mosques who see radicalization to tell the authorities about it.	0
345	KASICH	Because I have got to tell you, the vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims, they think their religion has been hijacked, that we have murderers out there who have distorted their religion.	0
346	KASICH	And they want to stop had as much as we want to stop it.	0
347	KASICH	So the fact is let’s isolate those people who are the killers and let’s work together as a community of civilized people to take the battle to them.	0
348	KASICH	Destroy ISIS, that’s a given, and then after that great intelligence to make sure we can thwart these attacks and get the Europeans to start, you know, paying attention and doing their job.	0
349	KASICH	I mean, that’s what I think we need to do, sir.	0

358	QUESTION	And welcome to the great state of Wisconsin, governor.	0
359	QUESTION	I represent a manufacturer, farm equipment manufacturer, here in Wisconsin that directly employs many thousands of people.	0
360	QUESTION	Indirectly, as you can imagine, with farm equipment that we sell, we indirectly support many more thousand farmers who buy our equipment.	0
361	QUESTION	On top of that we export about a third of our product that we manufacture here in essence.	0
362	QUESTION	So in essence, we’re a global manufacturing company.	0
363	QUESTION	To spark a war right now would not only be detrimental to business, but all of those people directly and indirectly that I said we support.	0
364	QUESTION	My question to you is, as president, how would you engage in diplomacy that won’t hurt global manufacturing businesses?	0
365	KASICH	Yes, number one, I want you to know, sir, that in my state now, we have over 63,000 new manufacturing jobs.	0
366	KASICH	It’s really cool that — and we’re paying attention to all the sectors, which we need to do as a nation.	0
367	KASICH	Let’s talk about trade for a second.	0
368	KASICH	It’s a tough issue.	0
369	KASICH	One out of five Americans work for something related to trade, and secondly, that’s 38 million Americans.	0
370	KASICH	Now we need to have open and free trade.	0
371	KASICH	You know, I was saying — I do these townhalls all the time.	0
372	KASICH	I love them, by the way.	0
373	KASICH	Look, remember when we got all of those Japanese cars coming into our country?	0
374	KASICH	You know what happened to U.S. cars?	0
375	KASICH	They got better.	0
376	KASICH	Innovation and competition really works, okay.	0
377	KASICH	But at the same time when we do trade agreements and other countries cheat, and they do cheat — some of them manipulate their currency, and we need to call them on it when they do it.	0
378	KASICH	When we find it, we need to call them on it.	0
379	KASICH	But let me tell you another issue for you.	0
380	KASICH	So we had U.S. steel invest a lot of money in state.	0
381	KASICH	They invest money all over the country.	0
382	KASICH	The Koreans were dumping tubes inside the U.S.  That means selling product below the cost of what it took them to make  them.	0
383	KASICH	By the time you research them and prove your case, which you would have to do, it could be a year or two and all your people are out of work.	0
384	KASICH	We need an early-warning system.	0
385	KASICH	And let me tell you, when they cheat, I will act as the president of the United States.	0
386	KASICH	Think of it this way.	0
387	KASICH	If Ohio State came up to play your beloved Badgers and I asked for five downs to get a first down and you only got four, how would you feel?	0
388	KASICH	You wouldn’t put up with it, okay?	0
389	KASICH	We should not put up with countries when they cheat.	0
390	KASICH	But that does not keep us from embracing the notion of open and free trade.	0
391	KASICH	One other thing, we now have this trade agreement on the table, you the TPP agreement.	0
392	KASICH	You know, what we basically do when we trade is we’re the most open country, and everybody else has barriers.	0
393	KASICH	So what we try to  do is to get their barriers down so we  get our products into their country.	0
394	KASICH	But there’s another element of this.	0
395	KASICH	You worry about the Chinese and their growing strength, particularly in Asia?	0
396	KASICH	Make a trade agreement, integrate ourselves with our friends in Asia who can become a bulwark against the strength of the Chinese.	0
397	COOPER	But governor…	0
398	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
399	KASICH	(inaudible) open trade good when they cheat.	0
400	KASICH	You’ve got to have an early-warning system.	0
401	KASICH	You’ve got to shut it off.	0
402	KASICH	And by the way, agriculture depends on exports more than about any other industry in this country.	0
403	COOPER	But, governor, that message isn’t resonate — I mean, Donald Trump is saying trade deals are essentially bad.	0
404	COOPER	They’re exporting jobs overseas.	0
405	COOPER	That’s the message which seems to be resonating with voters.	0
406	KASICH	Anderson, I can say all kinds of things to get people stirred up, but leaders don’t do that.	0
407	KASICH	Leaders tell people the way that they see it, even if it means for a while you’re unpopular.	0
408	KASICH	Look, when I — after my first — you can’t believe how many people I made angry in Washington by fighting to balance the budget.	0
409	KASICH	Now in Ohio, in my first year in office, I was one of the most unpopular governors, but I knew what the formula was, and now I’m one of the most popular governors.	0
410	KASICH	You cannot make decisions as a leader by putting your finger in the air and — or doing focus groups or telling people what they want to hear so you get them involved, but you know what they’re saying — what you’re saying is not true.	0
411	KASICH	I will not do that.	0
412	KASICH	I have never done it in my lifetime, and I’m not about to start.	0

418	QUESTION	Thank you, governor.	0
419	QUESTION	My question is, 70 years after World War II and a quarter century after the Cold War ended, a lot of European security remained a responsibility for Americans?	0
420	QUESTION	And given that Europeans are wealthy enough to defend themselves, why shouldn’t they?	0
421	KASICH	Well, young man, look, I don’t know if you’re a leader in your family or not.	0
422	KASICH	But leaders, you know, there are people in here who do more for their family than their brothers and sisters, their siblings.	0
423	KASICH	OK?	0
424	KASICH	And sometime, your spouse says why do we have do this all the time?	0
425	KASICH	Because that’s what leaders do.	0
426	KASICH	I mean, frankly, of course, the Europeans can do more to support themselves.	0
427	KASICH	Their economies, by and large, have been a shambles.	0
428	KASICH	So, they need to straighten out their economies.	0
429	KASICH	And it’s a really tough struggle.	0
430	KASICH	I mean, I can tell you that it’s hard for them to get right with things.	0
431	KASICH	So, they are weak economically.	0
432	KASICH	That doesn’t excuse them from not carrying their share of the load.	0
433	KASICH	But at the same time, we don’t want to have those relationships deteriorate or be eliminated.	0
434	KASICH	You know why?	0
435	KASICH	Because it hurts us, too.	0
436	KASICH	We need to have a strong Western Europe.	0
437	KASICH	And by the way, I heard – I just heard briefly somebody was saying that we should just ignore Ukraine.	0
438	KASICH	Are you kidding me?	0
439	KASICH	The United States of America should be arming the Ukrainians who want to fight for freedom against Putin.	0
440	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
441	KASICH	We should be arming them with non-lethal – with lethal defensive aid.	0
442	KASICH	Now, young man, we should always tell them you’ve got to do more.	0
443	KASICH	And we should use whatever leverage we have to get them to do more.	0
444	KASICH	But I’m going to tell you as Americans, as long as I’ve been alive, we always carry more of the share of the burden than we would like.	0
445	KASICH	We always do.	0
446	KASICH	And you know there’s an old Scripture that says “To whom much is given, much is expected.”  And as president, I would fight to get them to give us more, and I would use whatever leverage I could to get them to give us more.	0
447	KASICH	But to be honest with you, we’re always going to complain about this.	0
448	KASICH	But to walk away from that alliance, are you kidding me?	0
449	KASICH	If we walk away and it gets weaker, how long do you think it will take the Islamists to come over here?	0
450	KASICH	We need to work with them to destroy ISIS in the Middle East, and then we’ve got to work together as a society.	0
451	KASICH	That’s the way it works.	0
452	KASICH	So, there’s no easy way out of this.	0
453	KASICH	And you know, when you are a leader who has seen these things, then you get a sobering approach.	0
454	KASICH	That’s why the “Journal Centennial” here in Milwaukee said Kasich is a pragmatic conservative.	0
455	KASICH	Because you just can’t knock all the pieces off the chess board when you get frustrated.	0
456	KASICH	It’s a good question, there.	0
457	COOPER	Governor, thank you.	0

465	COOPER	Thanks very much for joining us again.	0
466	COOPER	I want to ask you a question which I asked to each of the other candidates as well, and had some surprising answers.	0
467	COOPER	A pledge was made early on in this race by all the GOP candidates, saying that they would pledge to support whoever the nominee was.	0
468	COOPER	Tonight Donald Trump said that pledge, essentially, was null and void.	0
469	COOPER	He would not pledge to continue to support whoever the nominee is, he would have to wait and see.	0
470	COOPER	And, Ted Cruz wouldn’t really answer it, but implied that a lot has changed, and that not that Donald Trump has…	0
471	KASICH	… Maybe I won’t answer it either.	0
472	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
473	KASICH	Anderson, here’s the thing, this is what you have to weigh, and I wish everybody could get out and experience this.	0
474	KASICH	When you’re in the arena, OK?	0
475	KASICH	You develop respect for people that are in the arena, but you know?	0
476	KASICH	I’ve been disturbed by some of the things that I’ve seen, and I have to think about what my word and endorsement would mean in a presidential campaign.	0
477	KASICH	So, I want to see how this thing finishes out, and you know what?	0
478	KASICH	I want to tell you, I think the little engine that can keeps going.	0
479	KASICH	I sure hope they’ll endorse me for president when I’m the nominee coming out of the convention in Cleveland, how’s that?	0
480	KASICH	Is that a good answer?	0
481	KASICH	I don’t know.	0
482	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
483	SYSTEM	(LAUGHING)	0
484	COOPER	I would be remiss not to follow up, essentially you’re saying it’s in the balance.	0
485	COOPER	You’re kind of waiting to see?	0
486	KASICH	Well, I would say that that would be a good way to describe it.	0
487	COOPER	So, you’re not ironclad, standing by the initial pledge to support whoever the nominee is?	0
488	KASICH	You know, frankly, all of us shouldn’t have even answered that question, but it was the first debate, and — you know?	0
489	KASICH	What the heck, sometimes you answer questions — you ought to just say I’m not answering it.	0
490	COOPER	So, now, just to be clear…	0
491	KASICH	… I’m as clear as you’re going to get out of me.	0
492	COOPER	You’re not standing by that pledge…	0
493	KASICH	No, I don’t want to be political here.	0
494	KASICH	I got to see what happens.	0
495	KASICH	If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the  country, and dividing the country, I can’t stand behind them, but we have a ways to go.	0
496	KASICH	Let’s see how this all folds out, and then I’ll let you know…	0
497	COOPER	… Is it fair to say that you believe Donald Trump looks like he would harm the country if he was the nominee?	0
498	KASICH	That’ll be up to the voters here.	0
499	KASICH	I’m not going to get into that.	0
500	KASICH	That’s too much below the belt.	0
501	COOPER	I want to introduce you to Time Carey, he’s a small business owner.	0
502	COOPER	He says she’s still undecided.	0
503	COOPER	Tim, welcome.	0
504	QUESTION	Hello, Governor, welcome to Wisconsin.	0
505	QUESTION	My family and I raced sled dogs in Northern Wisconsin, and this last year we started a business manufacturing sled dog equipment, a partner of mine and myself.	0
506	QUESTION	I funded the whole thing myself so far up to this point, and I just — I was wondering what your policies on small business to help people get small businesses going, or tax incentives, or what your thoughts were on that.	0
507	KASICH	I hate to keep talking about my state, but it’s a good illustration of my philosophy if I become president.	0
508	KASICH	Our small businesses pay virtually no income tax in Ohio because we want small businesses to grow, and for the young people that are here, the best chance you have of getting a job once you graduate from college is with a small business.	0
509	KASICH	So, I’m for lowering the income taxes nationally.	0
510	KASICH	I’d like to have a 28, a 25 and a 10 percent rate because you probably pay through on your personal taxes, you have a pass-through corporation.	0
511	KASICH	So, we need to bring the taxes down and help small businesses.	0
512	KASICH	The other thing we have to be careful of is we’re not snuffing out the small lending institutions, the community banks.	0
513	KASICH	I was – where was I?	0
514	KASICH	I was in La Crosse, and I went to this little bakery.	0
515	KASICH	And this woman proudly was talking about how she built this bakery business.	0
516	KASICH	It was a fantastic place.	0
517	KASICH	And she said a got a $9,000 loan.	0
518	KASICH	I said, how did you get it?	0
519	KASICH	She said, well, I went to one local community bank and said if you have won’t loan me the money, I’m going to go to the one down the street.	0
520	KASICH	What we’re facing now in America because of the overregulation on some of the big banks that’s trickled down to the smaller banks is we’re beginning to see the smaller banks go out of business.	0
521	KASICH	Those are the ones you depend upon to get the loan you need because they know you, right?	0
522	KASICH	So I think first of all, lower taxes – of course, for you.	0
523	KASICH	Commonsense regulation so we’re not crushing you with another stupid for that somebody in the government decides you have to abide by.	0
524	KASICH	And a path to fiscal stability, a balanced budget.	0
525	KASICH	Those are the things that will help you more than anything else.	0
526	KASICH	And one final thing: workforce development.	0
527	KASICH	We have got to begin to teach our kids in K through 12 and also in the community college and the four-year schools to be getting an education for a job that exists.	0
528	KASICH	Don’t get educated in a vacuum.	0
529	KASICH	Make sure you know what you want to do, and look for an education that can lead you to a real job.	0

539	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Yeah, any time.	0
540	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Thank you.	0
541	COOPER	I want to follow up on that, because you often – and you’ve done it tonight – touting Ohio’s economic record.	0
542	COOPER	According to FactCheck.org, Ohio has actually lagged behind the nation in job growth during your tenure as governor.	0
543	COOPER	So why — if that’s true, because they say –	0
544	KASICH	Well, that’s not true.	0
545	COOPER	Well, they say private sector job in Ohio was 9.3 percent during your tenure.	0
546	COOPER	The national private sector job growth rate was 11.7 percent —	0
547	KASICH	Anderson, we were 48th when I became governor, now we’re in the top 10.	0
548	KASICH	We went from at 350,000 job loss to a 417,000 job gain.	0
549	KASICH	We’re doing very, very well.	0
550	KASICH	But we’re not out of the woods yet.	0
551	KASICH	But — let’s go back to Washington.	0
552	KASICH	When I fought for all those years to balance the budget, cut the capital gains tax — that’s the tax  that gentleman uses when is he takes a risk — jobs were flying out like you couldn’t believe.	0
553	KASICH	And there was no discussion of income inequality.	0
554	KASICH	There are three things needed to grow an economy: common sense regulations; we don’t have them now.	0
555	KASICH	Lower taxes; all the taxes are going up.	0
556	KASICH	And a balanced – and a movement toward a balanced budget.	0
557	KASICH	And we’re blowing all the budget up.	0
558	KASICH	So you go to the doctor, say, how do I get healthy?	0
559	KASICH	They say, well, you do these three things.	0
560	KASICH	You go back, say, I’m not feeling well.	0
561	KASICH	And he or she says, well, what did you do?	0
562	KASICH	Well, I didn’t listen to anything you said.	0
563	KASICH	‘	0
564	KASICH	So, this is a formula that will work to bring our country back.	0
565	KASICH	Folks, I only say it because I’m only doing this because I want to you have job security.	0
566	KASICH	And I want to you believe that your kids are going to have a better life than you got from your parents.	0
567	KASICH	That’s the great American legacy and that’s when I’m committed to, folks.	0

598	COOPER	He says he is slightly leaning towards Ted Cruz but that his heart is with you, governor.	0
599	COOPER	Joseph?	0
600	KASICH	Well, then go with the heart, man!	0
601	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
602	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	Well, I’ll try to ask a heart-felt question here, Governor.	0
603	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	I’m curious to know how you may have shown moral courage in the face of public opposition.	0
604	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	So can you cite an action that you took or decision that you made knowing it was the right thing to do, despite it being politically unpopular?	0
605	KASICH	Well, I — look, I don’t want to get into how courageous I am or anything, but look, we — the gentleman stood up, first question out of here was Medicaid expansion.	0
606	KASICH	I knew it wasn’t going to be all that popular.	0
607	KASICH	Of course I wasn’t thinking about running for president.	0
608	KASICH	I’ll tell you the story.	0
609	KASICH	I had this woman, she’s terrific.	0
610	KASICH	She runs our mental health, drug addiction services.	0
611	KASICH	She comes into my office and says — I said to her, do you think I’m going to expand Medicaid?	0
612	KASICH	And she says, well, I pray every night you will.	0
613	KASICH	And I said, well, okay, your prayers are answered; I’m going do it.	0
614	KASICH	She walked out of my office into the ante (ph) room and broke down and cried of joy for the fact that she can now help more people.	0
615	KASICH	You know, the fact is, is that you can’t sit around worrying about who is really going to like you.	0
616	KASICH	I’ll give you another one.	0
617	KASICH	When I was in Washington, I said if we’re going to reform welfare for the poor people, we ought to reform it for the rich people.	0
618	KASICH	So I fought for corporate welfare reform.	0
619	KASICH	And we closed some of the loopholes that these big companies got when they moved — you know, when they moved out of the country to get — or moved to Puerto Rico, for example, to get tax advantages.	0
620	KASICH	I thought it was the right thing to do.	0
621	KASICH	You wouldn’t believe how hard it was to get the federal budget balanced.	0
622	KASICH	One time we had a conference, I wanted to present the opposition to the Clinton tax increase, and I had a specific program to fight that, and we had a Republican conference, and Newt was sitting in the back of the room, and we had 36 speakers, and 34 said, Kasich shouldn’t unveil this plan.	0
623	KASICH	I walked to the back of the room.	0
624	KASICH	I said, Newt, how are we doing?	0
625	KASICH	He said, better than I thought we’d be.	0
626	KASICH	The plan got out.	0
627	KASICH	And if you ever heard Joe Scarborough talk, the battle that we engaged in, in ’93 and ’94 against the Clinton tax increases inspired him to run for Congress, and brought a whole new wave of people into the Congress.	0
628	KASICH	Sir, what you have to realize in this business is you’re there for a short period of time.	0
629	KASICH	You have to drive the car when you get your hands on the wheel, and you got to have people around that will tell you when you’re on the wrong path, because sometimes you get on the wrong path.	0
630	KASICH	But I have to also tell you, you don’t ever want to look back and say, I played politics, I took care of my party and I didn’t serve the people.	0
631	KASICH	So I’ve been in politics a long time.	0
632	KASICH	I’m as a big of a reformer and an idealist as I was the day I got elected, because I believe we can  change the world and make the world better for everyone.	0
633	KASICH	And sometimes you get people upset.	0
634	KASICH	That’s kind of goes with the territory.	0
635	KASICH	You know what Harry Truman said, if you want a friend and you’re in Washington, you better go get a dog.	0
636	KASICH	Okay?	0
637	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
638	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
639	COOPER	This is Charlotte Rasmussen.	0
640	COOPER	Charlote Rasmussen.	0
641	COOPER	She’s from the township of Butler.	0
642	COOPER	She’s retired.	0
643	COOPER	She says she’s undecided.	0
644	COOPER	Welcome, Charlotte.	0
645	QUESTION	Hello.	0
646	QUESTION	Governor Kasich, if you become the nominee of the party, who are you going to pick for your vice president?	0
647	KASICH	Are you available?	0
648	KASICH	You look great tonight.	0
649	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
650	KASICH	No, you know what, that’s so far ahead.	0
651	KASICH	That’s like measuring the drapes.	0
652	KASICH	But I picked a lieutenant governor, somebody to run with me, a great woman, she was our auditor, and I picked her to run with me because she understood what I wanted to accomplish, and she was willing to be a really great teammate.	0
653	KASICH	She’s done great job.	0
654	KASICH	So you want to pick somebody who you’re comfortable with and somebody who understands what you’re all about, and somebody who’s not afraid to speak up to you.	0
655	KASICH	You see, you can’t just surround yourself with sycophants.	0
656	KASICH	You’ve got to have people there that can tell you, no, I don’t think that’s right, and then you argue it out.	0
657	KASICH	And at the end, though, at the end, once you decide, the whole team moves in the same direction.	0
658	KASICH	I have been able to be able to accomplish things in politics, I’m going to tell you, not because I’m so great, but I’ve been able to attract people throughout the years — I have some people that have been around me for 30 years.	0
659	KASICH	And we form a great team, and we keep our eyes on the horizon.	0
660	KASICH	And you know what I believe, I think everybody wants to be involved with something that’s bigger than themselves.	0
661	KASICH	And that’s what I always try to represent and present in public life.	0
662	KASICH	So it’d be somebody along those lines.	0
663	KASICH	Okay?	0
664	KASICH	Aaron Rodgers maybe if he had a better year next year.	0
665	KASICH	We’ll see.	0
666	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
667	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
668	COOPER	We’re going take a quick break.	0
669	COOPER	We’re going to have more with Governor Kasich as our CNN Republican townhall continues from Milwaukee.	0
670	COOPER	We’ll be right back.	0
671	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
672	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
673	COOPER	Welcome back.	0
674	COOPER	We’re here with Governor John Kasich of Ohio.	0
675	COOPER	We’re here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.	0
676	COOPER	Yesterday CNN reported that your campaign is looking to work or coordinate behind the scenes with the Cruz campaign in an effort to try to deny Donald Trump delegates to get to the nomination.	0
677	COOPER	Is that something — I mean, have approached Ted Cruz directly about that yourself?	0
678	KASICH	No, no, I’m not involved in the process stuff.	0
679	KASICH	I mean, campaigns always talk.	0
680	KASICH	I mean, there is always ways they do it.	0
681	KASICH	But I’m not in the middle of that.	0
682	KASICH	And I haven’t seen Ted since the last debate.	0
683	KASICH	So I’m not involved in that.	0
684	COOPER	We were talking during the break about how many townhalls.	0
685	COOPER	You said you’ve probably done over 200 or so.	0
686	KASICH	Yes.	0
687	KASICH	Just like this.	0
688	COOPER	And I remember, I spoke with you at a townhall that we did in South Carolina.	0
689	COOPER	And one of the things you said to that has always stuck in my mind, I kind of wanted to follow up with you about.	0
690	COOPER	You said that this campaign has caused you to slow down.	0
691	COOPER	And I wondered — it was in reference to an incident you had with a young man at a town hall.	0
692	KASICH	I’ve had many incidents.	0
693	COOPER	In what way has it caused you to slow down?	0
694	KASICH	Well, because there’s a lot of lonely people out there.	0
695	KASICH	They come to my meetings and they say things — I haven’t seen it in Wisconsin, but I have seen it all over the country.	0
696	KASICH	And the young man that gave me a hug was just emblematic of what I’ve seen all over.	0
697	KASICH	I think when people want to feel safe and for some reason they come to the townhalls I have, which are basically townhalls about how we can fix things and how we can be hopeful, and for some reason people feel safe.	0
698	KASICH	And I — that’s the grace of the lord as far as I’m concerned, to let people feel that way.	0
699	KASICH	And, I would also say — and this is important.	0
700	KASICH	I want to ship a lot of programs back to the states, but here’s what I really want everybody to know I believe.	0
701	KASICH	The spirit of our country, Anderson, doesn’t rest in the president.	0
702	KASICH	I mean, the president’s important, but the spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods, it rests in the people who are here tonight.	0
703	KASICH	We’re the ones that need to change the world, we’re the ones that need to fix education, deal with the problems of the poor.	0
704	KASICH	You know, one of the things I’ve said, you take a lady who was married 50 years, her husband died, nobody calls her anymore.	0
705	KASICH	Call her on a Monday, what does she do on a Thursday?	0
706	KASICH	She’s gets her hair done, then when Saturday comes, when you’re going to take her to dinner somehow not one hair is out of place.	0
707	KASICH	When you pick her up she wears a dress she hadn’t worn in six months.	0
708	KASICH	Are you changing the world?	0
709	KASICH	I think you are.	0
710	KASICH	When a nurse spends an extra 15 minutes with a family that’s in trouble and says things are going to be OK, Anderson, I just happen to believe — I don’t want to get too carried away here.	0
711	KASICH	But, you know?	0
712	KASICH	The Lord’s given us all a certain purpose in life, and we need to carry it out.	0
713	KASICH	We need to live a life bigger than ourselves.	0
714	KASICH	Now, I’m not applying for sainthood, and neither is anybody else, but we can get up every day and try to live a life to help heal this world.	0
715	KASICH	We need the solutions in Washington to create the jobs.	0
716	KASICH	That is an absolute — without jobs we don’t have anything.	0
717	KASICH	But, when we shift welfare, education, infrastructure, job training, Medicaid programs back to the states then we’ve got to run them, and we have to run them where we live.	0
718	KASICH	And, frankly, state government ought to be shifting more power to the neighborhoods.	0
719	KASICH	That’s the spirit of our country.	0
720	KASICH	The spirit of our country — don’t you think where we live?	0
721	KASICH	It’s in you.	0
722	KASICH	It’s in you.	0
723	KASICH	It’s in me, and him.	0
724	KASICH	It’s not in somebody, you know, down in Washington D.C.	0
725	KASICH	You think?	0
726	KASICH	I mean, I hope so.	0
727	KASICH	I believe that.	0
728	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
729	COOPER	I want to thank you for taking part.	0
730	KASICH	That’s it?	0
731	COOPER	Yeah.	0
732	COOPER	I want to thank you for this town hall, we’d love to do another one.	0
733	COOPER	That is all the time we have.	0
734	COOPER	I want to thank all the candidates, thank the voters who had such good questions.	0
735	COOPER	Everyone in this room who made tonight possible, including the Riverside Theater and Turner Hall here in Milwaukee.	0
736	COOPER	Thank You.	0
737	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
