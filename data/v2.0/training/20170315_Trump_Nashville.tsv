205	Donald Trump	But let me give you the bad, the sad news.	0
206	Donald Trump	Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii -- part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court -- and I have to be nice; otherwise I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.	0
207	Donald Trump	I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world -- I will be criticized -- I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.	0
208	Donald Trump	I would never want to do that.	0
209	Donald Trump	A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.	0
210	Audience	Booo --	0
211	Donald Trump	The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.	0
212	Donald Trump	This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's -- in my opinion -- flawed ruling.	0
213	Donald Trump	This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.	0
214	Donald Trump	The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems -- or she -- or she.	0
215	Donald Trump	Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.	0
216	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
217	Donald Trump	When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.	0
218	Donald Trump	So we have a lot of lawyers here.	0
219	Donald Trump	We also have a lot of smart people here.	0
220	Donald Trump	Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration -- and you know what I'm talking about, right?	0
221	Donald Trump	Can I read this to you?	0
222	Donald Trump	Listen to this.	0
223	Donald Trump	Now, we're all smart people.	0
224	Donald Trump	We're all good students -- some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.	0
225	Donald Trump	Ready?	0
226	Donald Trump	So here's the statute -- which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it.	0
227	Donald Trump	And it was put here for the security of our country.	0
228	Donald Trump	And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.	0
229	Donald Trump	And sometimes we need it very badly for security -- security of our country.	0
230	Donald Trump	It says -- now, listen how easy this is.	0
231	Donald Trump	Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he -- see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she.	0
232	Donald Trump	You know, today they'd say that.	0
233	Donald Trump	Actually, that's the only mistake they made.	0
234	Donald Trump	as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."	0
235	Donald Trump	In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she -- whoever is President -- can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please.	0
236	Donald Trump	We've got enough problems.	0

305	Donald Trump	There was with Obama.	0
306	Donald Trump	There was with Bush.	0
307	Donald Trump	The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.	0
308	Donald Trump	I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington -- I* was always very politically active -- and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.	0
309	Donald Trump	Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.	0

311	Donald Trump	That's the way it is.	0
312	Donald Trump	That's how much divisiveness and other things there are.	0
313	Donald Trump	So it's a problem.	0
314	Donald Trump	But we're going to get it by.	0
315	Donald Trump	So, I've met with so many victims of Obamacare ---- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.	0
316	Donald Trump	At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw -- the government forcing people to buy a government--approved product.	0
317	Donald Trump	There are very few people -- very few people.	0

319	Donald Trump	By the way -- watch what happens.	0

328	Donald Trump	Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.	0
329	Donald Trump	But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.	0
330	Donald Trump	So we'll see.	0
331	Donald Trump	It's the fake, fake media.	0
332	Donald Trump	We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.	0
333	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
334	Donald Trump	The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together and we're going to get something done.	0
335	Donald Trump	Remember this -- if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.	0
336	Donald Trump	They won't vote, no matter what we do, they're not going to vote.	0
337	Donald Trump	So we're doing it a different way, a complex way.	0
338	Donald Trump	It's fine.	0
339	Donald Trump	The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three -- it's going to be great.	0
