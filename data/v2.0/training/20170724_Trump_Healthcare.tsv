1	Mike Pence	Well, thank you, Dr. Price.	0
2	Mike Pence	And good afternoon to all.	0
3	Mike Pence	To the families who are gathered here from all across America, on behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House.	0
4	Mike Pence	Since the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has been working to keep the promises that he made to the American people to rebuild our military, revive our economy.	0
5	Mike Pence	And this President has worked tirelessly to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
6	Mike Pence	President Trump knows that every day Obamacare survives is another day that American families and American businesses struggle.	0
7	Mike Pence	As we've traveled across the country, we've heard firsthand from Americans just like those who stand behind me today, from families who are bearing the cost of skyrocketing premiums and plummeting choices, from families who've lost their doctors, lost their insurance, and from families who are starting to lose hope that Congress will ever respond.	0
8	Mike Pence	But as I've told every one of them and people all across this country, thanks to the leadership of President Trump, help is on the way.	0
9	Mike Pence	President Trump hears you.	0
10	Mike Pence	He is fighting for you, and he will keep fighting every day until we give the American people access to the world-class health care they deserve.	0
11	Mike Pence	Tomorrow, the United States Senate will have the opportunity to begin the debate on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
12	Mike Pence	And as the President said this morning, after years of talking and campaigning on it, now is the time for Republicans in the Senate to act.	0
13	Mike Pence	Republicans in the Senate will have in his words a "chance to do the right thing" to keep their promise to the American people and these families and families all across this country.	0
14	Mike Pence	And this President and the American people are counting on the Senate to act.	0
15	Mike Pence	So with gratitude for his leadership and his persistence and determination to make American health care great again, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to these families and to all of you the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump.	0
16	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
17	Donald Trump	Well thank you very much Vice President Pence, Secretary Price, and thank you everyone for being here today.	0
18	Donald Trump	For the past 17 years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent hardworking Americans.	0
19	Donald Trump	Behind me today, we have real American families, great families.	0
20	Donald Trump	We've spent a lot of time with them.	0
21	Donald Trump	We're suffering, because, seven years ago a small group of politicians and special interests in Washington engineered a government takeover of health care.	0
22	Donald Trump	Every pledge that Washington Democrats made to pass that bill turned out to be a lie.	0
23	Donald Trump	It was a big fat ugly lie.	0
24	Donald Trump	Democrats promised Americans like Steve Finn, a former police officer in West Virginia, that they would save $2,500 a year under Obamacare.	0
25	Donald Trump	Instead, his premiums have more than tripled.	0
26	Donald Trump	That's pretty bad.	0
27	Donald Trump	As a result of Obamacare skyrocketing cost, Steve and his family, and many of his employees, had no other option than going on Medicaid and giving up their existing coverage.	0
28	Donald Trump	No choice.	0
29	Donald Trump	For them, Obamacare, as promised, was a nightmare.	0
30	Donald Trump	Marjorie and Kevin Weer from South Carolina, have a son Monty who suffers from Spina Bifida.	0
31	Donald Trump	Washington Democrats promise families like the Weer's that if they like their doctor, they could keep their doctor.	0
32	Donald Trump	But now there's only one insurer left in the state exchange and Marjorie says that every year she waits anxious to learn if the doctors and hospitals, which our son needs the most, will remain in their network.	0
33	Donald Trump	More Obamacare lies, and you've seen that up front, unfortunately, up front and personal.	0
34	Donald Trump	The Democrats promised Melissa Ackinson that her son's pre-existing conditions would be covered.	0
35	Donald Trump	The Ackinson quickly learned that Obamacare's promise of covering for pre-existing conditions was meaningless, though, if the doctors you need for your care aren't on your Obamacare plan.	0
36	Donald Trump	So you just have a meaningless promise and everybody knows it, and most people on Obamacare know it.	0
37	Donald Trump	After an excruciating series of events and complications, Melissa and her husband found themselves just before Christmas, emotionally and financially devastated crying in a doctor's office, faced with yet another seemingly unpayable bill.	0
38	Donald Trump	When insurance wouldn't cover the Ackinson's care, they emptied out Melissa's 401k to pay their bills.	0
39	Donald Trump	They're not going to be, and they haven't been the first.	0
40	Donald Trump	There are many many cases such as that.	0
41	Donald Trump	The 401ks.	0
42	Donald Trump	The first rule of medicine, is do no harm, but Obamacares lies, have caused this, and throughout the whole country, families like this, nothing but pain.	0
43	Donald Trump	Erin and Andy Witzig, our small business owners from Illinois.	0
44	Donald Trump	They have six children, their youngest daughter Poppy has a rare genetic condition.	0
45	Donald Trump	Children born with it or sometimes called butterfly children, because their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly.	0
46	Donald Trump	Poppy has to wear special bandages all of the time.	0
47	Donald Trump	Unfortunately, under Obamacare.	0
48	Donald Trump	Poppy's insurance has been repeatedly discontinued and replaced with what Washington deems equivalent policies, but for Poppy, these plans are not equivalent and Poppy's family has to spend precious time and tremendous resources fighting for exceptions for Poppy.	0
49	Donald Trump	The Washington politicians who made those promises to Steve, Marjorie, Melissa, Erin and their beautiful children want to ignore all the pain, all the suffering and all of the money, the tremendous amounts of money, that these lies have caused.	0
50	Donald Trump	They want to forget about the countless Americans they've hurt.	0
51	Donald Trump	and the many that they are continuing to hurt every day, by refusing to help us replace Obamacare.	0
52	Donald Trump	For the last seven years, Republicans have been united and standing up for Obamacare's victims, remember, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
53	Donald Trump	They kept saying it over And over again.	0
54	Donald Trump	Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law.	0
55	Donald Trump	We, as a party, must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country, to repeal and replace what they've been saying for the last seven years.	0
56	Donald Trump	But so far Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.	0
57	Donald Trump	They now have a chance, however, to hopefully, hopefully fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time, and that is through replacement of a horrible disaster known as Obamacare.	0
58	Donald Trump	The Senate is very close to the votes it needs to pass a replacement.	0
59	Donald Trump	The problem is, we have zero help from the Democrats.	0
60	Donald Trump	They're obstructionist, that's all they are.	0
61	Donald Trump	That's all they're good at is obstruction, making things not work.	0
62	Donald Trump	They say all the right things, and then they do exactly what they're not supposed to be doing.	0
63	Donald Trump	The Democrats aren't giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans.	0
64	Donald Trump	Not easy to do.	0
65	Donald Trump	The Senate bill that is being considered outside of the outright repeal of Obamacare will also provide emergency relief for the law's victims, and it will deliver truly great health care and health care reforms that our citizens want, need and really should be demanding.	0
66	Donald Trump	Some are demanding.	0
67	Donald Trump	You'll see that at the voter booth.	0
68	Donald Trump	believe me.	0
69	Donald Trump	Here are just some of these terrific reforms that we will be doing if everything works out the way it should.	0
70	Donald Trump	The Senate bill eliminates the painful individual mandate.	0
71	Donald Trump	It eliminates the job-killing employer mandate, repeals other burdensome taxes, and will significantly lower Americans premiums.	0
72	Donald Trump	It will stabilize collapsing health insurance markets and give Americans far more choice and far more flexibility.	0
73	Donald Trump	The Senate bill protects coverage for pre-existing conditions, and you don't hear this from the Democrats.	0
74	Donald Trump	They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn't even know the bill.	0
75	Donald Trump	They run out, they say: death, death, death.	0
76	Donald Trump	Well, Obamacare is death, that's the one that's death.	0
77	Donald Trump	And, besides that, it's failing, so you won't have it anyway.	0
78	Donald Trump	It dramatically expands popular health savings accounts	0
79	Donald Trump	It provides tax credits, so Americans can purchase a private plan that is right for them and their families.	0
80	Donald Trump	It devotes substantial resources to fight the opioid, and this is a tremendous problem, the opioid epidemic.	0
81	Donald Trump	$45 billion is being put in, so that the people of many states like New Hampshire, Ohio and so many others that have such a big problem, can be helped and helped greatly.	0
82	Donald Trump	Gonna be fighting the drug problems very, very seriously, in my administration.	0
83	Donald Trump	And it provides among many other things, higher quality care and more flexibility for states to administer Medicaid to better serve their poorest citizens.	0
84	Donald Trump	Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether to allow this urgently needed bill to come to the Senate floor for debate.	0
85	Donald Trump	The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare's architects which have been so destructive to our country, or with it's forgotten victims.	0
86	Donald Trump	Any senator who votes against starting debate, is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, which is what it is.	0
87	Donald Trump	For Democrats, this vote is a chance to make up for the terrible harm they have inflicted on Americans, like those who are with us today, Obamacare has been for them a nightmare.	0
88	Donald Trump	There is still time to do the right thing and for Senate Republicans, this is their chance to keep their promise.	0
89	Donald Trump	Over and over again, they said, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
90	Donald Trump	But they can now keep their promise to the American people to provide emergency relief to those in desperate need of help and to improve health care for all Americans.	0
91	Donald Trump	To every member of the Senate, I say this: the American people have waited long enough.	0
92	Donald Trump	There's been enough talk and no action.	0
93	Donald Trump	Now is the time for action.	0
94	Donald Trump	We are here to solve problems for the people.	0
95	Donald Trump	Obamacare has broken our health care system.	1
96	Donald Trump	It's broken.	0
97	Donald Trump	It's collapsing.	0
98	Donald Trump	It's gone.	0
99	Donald Trump	And now it is up to us to get great health care for the American people.	0
100	Donald Trump	We must repeal and replace Obamacare now.	0
101	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
102	Donald Trump	God bless you.	0
103	Donald Trump	God bless the United States of America.	0
104	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
105	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
