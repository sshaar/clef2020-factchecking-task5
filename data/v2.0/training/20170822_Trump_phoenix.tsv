17	Donald Trump	The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here.	1
18	Donald Trump	And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates.	0
19	Donald Trump	We love those debates.	0
20	Donald Trump	But we went to center stage and we never left, right?	0

41	Donald Trump	It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.	0

43	Donald Trump	It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing.	0

45	Donald Trump	After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women -- remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election?	0
46	Donald Trump	Guess what?	0
47	Donald Trump	They're not forgotten... anymore, right?	0
48	Donald Trump	Anymore.	0
49	Donald Trump	No, they're not forgotten anymore folks.	0
50	Donald Trump	In fact, they're trying to figure you out.	0
51	Donald Trump	They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us?	0
52	Donald Trump	I don't think that's going to happen any time soon.	0
53	Donald Trump	We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.	0
54	Donald Trump	Respect for America demands respect for all of its people.	0
55	Donald Trump	Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future.	0

63	Donald Trump	We're all together.	0
64	Donald Trump	It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers.	0
65	Donald Trump	And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers.	0
66	Donald Trump	No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.	0
67	Donald Trump	That's what we are.	0
68	Donald Trump	We're a team.	0

72	Donald Trump	We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.	0
73	Donald Trump	And it's happening, and it's happening fast.	0
74	Donald Trump	I see all those red hats and white hats.	0
75	Donald Trump	It's all happening very fast.	0
76	Donald Trump	It's called "Make America Great Again."	0
77	Donald Trump	You see what's going on.	0
78	Donald Trump	It's coming back, very fast.	0
79	Donald Trump	We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.	0
80	Donald Trump	What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America.	0
81	Donald Trump	And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence.	0
82	Donald Trump	But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras.	0
83	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
84	Donald Trump	So the -- and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories.	0
85	Donald Trump	They have no sources in many cases.	0
86	Donald Trump	They say "a source says" -- there is no such thing.	0
87	Donald Trump	But they don't report the facts.	0
88	Donald Trump	Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK.	0
89	Donald Trump	I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.	0
90	Donald Trump	So what I did -- So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK?	0
91	Donald Trump	I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.	0
92	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
93	Donald Trump	So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville -- and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know.	0
94	Donald Trump	Here's the first -- can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.	0
95	Donald Trump	Now they know.	0
96	Donald Trump	Now they finally know.	0
97	Donald Trump	But I -- I just -- I don't want to bore you with this, but I -- it shows you how dishonest they are.	0
98	Donald Trump	And most of you know this anyway.	0
99	Donald Trump	So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: "We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia" -- this is me speaking.	0
100	Donald Trump	We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."	0
101	Donald Trump	That's me speaking on Saturday.	0
102	Donald Trump	Right after the event.	0
103	Donald Trump	So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, "egregious display," "hatred, bigotry and violence."	0
104	Donald Trump	OK, I think I can't do much better, right?	0
105	Donald Trump	OK.	0
106	Donald Trump	But they didn't want to put this on.	0
107	Donald Trump	They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough.	0
108	Donald Trump	He didn't do it on time.	0
109	Donald Trump	Why did it take a day?	0
110	Donald Trump	He must be a racist.	0
111	Donald Trump	It took a day.	0
112	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
113	Donald Trump	Dishonest people.	0
114	Donald Trump	So here is -- here is me -- I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.	0
115	Donald Trump	They don't even do that.	0
116	Donald Trump	The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room.	1
117	Donald Trump	I call them anarchists.	0
118	Donald Trump	Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists.	0
119	Donald Trump	They don't want to talk about the anarchists.	0
120	Donald Trump	So this is me -- "it has no place in America."	0
121	Donald Trump	I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.	0
122	Donald Trump	It has no place in America.	0
123	Donald Trump	What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.	0
124	Donald Trump	No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.	0
125	Donald Trump	This is me speaking.	0
126	Donald Trump	Here's further.	0
127	Donald Trump	This is on Saturday, the first one.	0
128	Donald Trump	I did this three times.	0
129	Donald Trump	We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really -- and I say this so strongly -- "true affection for each other."	0
130	Donald Trump	I didn't say true affection for you and you.	0
131	Donald Trump	I said for each other, all of us.	0
132	Donald Trump	All of us.	0
133	Donald Trump	All of us.	0
134	Donald Trump	But they don't report it.	0
135	Donald Trump	They don't -- they just let it go.	0
136	Donald Trump	Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first.	0
137	Donald Trump	We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag.	0
138	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants USA]	0
139	Donald Trump	And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough.	0
140	Donald Trump	Why wasn't he more specific?	0
141	Donald Trump	So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster?	0
142	Donald Trump	The -- I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.	0
143	Donald Trump	And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false.	0
144	Donald Trump	If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know.	0
145	Donald Trump	You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.	0
146	Donald Trump	It's so bad.	0
147	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
148	Donald Trump	Or the Washington Post, which call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that's a lobbying tool for Amazon.	0
149	Donald Trump	Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.	0
150	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
151	Donald Trump	Right?	0
152	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants CNN Sucks]	0
153	Donald Trump	But all the networks -- I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning -- I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right?	0
154	Donald Trump	Little George.	0
155	Donald Trump	And -- and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?	0
156	Donald Trump	They had a hard time.	0
157	Donald Trump	They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing -- we were saying things -- and it really did.	0
158	Donald Trump	So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, "Let's get back to Charlottesville."	0
159	Donald Trump	Charlottesville.	0
160	Donald Trump	And Nikki was great.	0
161	Donald Trump	She's doing a great job, by the way.	0
162	Donald Trump	So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country.	0
163	Donald Trump	I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people.	0
164	Donald Trump	It says I love all of the people of our country.	0
165	Donald Trump	I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden.	0
166	Donald Trump	I love all the people of our country.	0
167	Donald Trump	So, I said here's my -- this is -- by the way folks, this is my exact words: "I love all the people of our country.	0
168	Donald Trump	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America."	0
169	Donald Trump	And then they say, is he a racist?	0
170	Donald Trump	Is he a racist?	0
171	Donald Trump	Then, I did a second one.	0
172	Donald Trump	So then I did a second one.	0
173	Donald Trump	Don't bother, it's only a single voice.	0
174	Donald Trump	And not a very powerful voice.	0
175	Donald Trump	How did he get in here?	0
176	Donald Trump	He's supposed to be with the few people outside.	0
177	Donald Trump	How about -- how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.	0
178	Donald Trump	Where are they?	0
179	Donald Trump	Well, it's hot out.	0
180	Donald Trump	It is hot.	0
181	Donald Trump	I think it's too warm.	0
182	Donald Trump	You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything -- Antifa!	0
183	Donald Trump	So on August the 14th -- so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?	0
184	Donald Trump	Now I figure I'm going to do it again.	0
185	Donald Trump	I'll be even more specific.	0
186	Donald Trump	So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.	0
187	Donald Trump	Because that was right after the event, the first one, right?	0
188	Donald Trump	An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody.	0
189	Donald Trump	To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered.	0
190	Donald Trump	That's what I said.	0
191	Donald Trump	Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that.	0
192	Donald Trump	They don't show it.	0
193	Donald Trump	They take -- they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.	0
194	Donald Trump	He was late.	0
195	Donald Trump	So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence.	0
196	Donald Trump	OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.	0
197	Donald Trump	We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right?	0
198	Donald Trump	Then I said, racism is evil.	0
199	Donald Trump	Do they report that I said that racism is evil?	0
200	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
201	Donald Trump	Because they are very dishonest people.	0
202	Donald Trump	So I said, racism is evil.	0
203	Donald Trump	Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.	0
204	Donald Trump	But, I mean do you ever see anything -- and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings.	1
205	Donald Trump	Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.	0
206	Donald Trump	And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey.	0
207	Donald Trump	Jeffrey Lord.	0
208	Donald Trump	I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.	0
209	Donald Trump	They said, we've better get out of here; we can't have that.	0
210	Donald Trump	And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.	0
211	Donald Trump	Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness?	0
212	Donald Trump	And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right. He doesn't have to say...	0
213	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
214	Donald Trump	You know why?	0
215	Donald Trump	Because they have a double standard.	0
216	Donald Trump	Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.	0
217	Donald Trump	You never heard them say that.	0
218	Donald Trump	And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized.	0
219	Donald Trump	But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.	0
220	Donald Trump	And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on.	0
221	Donald Trump	Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America.	0
222	Donald Trump	These are my words.	0
223	Donald Trump	This was on Monday, August 14th.	0
224	Donald Trump	So you had Saturday; you had Monday.	0
225	Donald Trump	You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right.	0
226	Donald Trump	In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.	0
227	Donald Trump	Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.	0
228	Donald Trump	And then I finished, I said, "We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans."	0
229	Donald Trump	All is capitalized times five.	0
230	Donald Trump	Not just you.	0
231	Donald Trump	And we will work together so that every citizen -- every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls.	0
232	Donald Trump	OK now, I mean -- so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.	0
233	Donald Trump	I hit him with neo-Nazi.	0
234	Donald Trump	I hit them with everything.	0
235	Donald Trump	I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi.	0
236	Donald Trump	I got them all in there, let's say.	0
237	Donald Trump	KKK, we have KKK.	0
238	Donald Trump	I got them all.	0
239	Donald Trump	So they're having a hard time.	0
240	Donald Trump	So what are they say, right?	0
241	Donald Trump	It should have been sooner.	0
242	Donald Trump	He's a racist.	0
243	Donald Trump	It should have been sooner, OK.	0
244	Donald Trump	So it should have been -- so then the last one, on Tuesday -- Tuesday I did another one: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.	0
245	Donald Trump	It has no place in America."	0
246	Donald Trump	But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.	0
247	Donald Trump	But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words.	0
248	Donald Trump	The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing.	0
249	Donald Trump	They said I didn't mention it.	0
250	Donald Trump	And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States?	0
251	Donald Trump	Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.	0
252	Donald Trump	But, they asked me the question.	0
253	Donald Trump	And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact.	0
254	Donald Trump	I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done -- over one million since I've been in office...	0
255	Donald Trump	Way over one million.	0
256	Donald Trump	I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.	0
257	Donald Trump	I do.	0
258	Donald Trump	I do.	0
259	Donald Trump	And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right?	1
260	Donald Trump	They haven't gone up for a long time.	0
261	Donald Trump	I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.	0
262	Donald Trump	So that was my words.	0
263	Donald Trump	Now, you know, I was a good student.	0
264	Donald Trump	I always hear about the elite.	0
265	Donald Trump	You know, the elite.	0
266	Donald Trump	They're elite?	0
267	Donald Trump	I went to better schools than they did.	0
268	Donald Trump	I was a better student than they were.	0
269	Donald Trump	I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.	0
270	Donald Trump	I think -- you know what?	0
271	Donald Trump	I think we're the elites.	0
272	Donald Trump	They're not the elites.	0
273	Donald Trump	So the point is -- and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from.	0
274	Donald Trump	You people understand.	0
275	Donald Trump	But the point is, that those were three different -- there were two statements and one news conference.	0
276	Donald Trump	The words were perfect.	0
277	Donald Trump	They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain.	0
278	Donald Trump	But they don't put on those words.	0
279	Donald Trump	And they don't put on me saying those words.	0
280	Donald Trump	The media can attack me.	0
281	Donald Trump	But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.	0
282	Donald Trump	When they attack the decency of our supporters.	0
283	Donald Trump	You are honest, hard-working, taxpaying -- and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down.	0
284	Donald Trump	You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.	0
285	Donald Trump	It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions.	0
286	Donald Trump	And yes, by the way -- and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage.	0
287	Donald Trump	You see that.	0
288	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
289	Donald Trump	And -- and I say it, and you know, we're all pros.	0
290	Donald Trump	We're all, like, we have a certain sense.	0
291	Donald Trump	We're smart people.	0
292	Donald Trump	These are truly dishonest people.	0
293	Donald Trump	And not all of them.	0
294	Donald Trump	Not all of them.	0
295	Donald Trump	You have some very good reporters.	0
296	Donald Trump	You have some very fair journalists.	0
297	Donald Trump	But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.	0
298	Donald Trump	And I really think they don't like our country.	0
299	Donald Trump	I really believe that.	0
300	Donald Trump	And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.	0
301	Donald Trump	If they would change, I would never say it.	0
302	Donald Trump	The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news.	0
303	Donald Trump	Oh, that's so funny.	0
304	Donald Trump	Look back there, the live red lights.	0
305	Donald Trump	They're turning those suckers off fast out there.	0
306	Donald Trump	They're turning those lights off fast.	0
307	Donald Trump	Like CNN.	0
308	Donald Trump	CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you.	0
309	Donald Trump	I mean, the advantage I have -- the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.	0
310	Donald Trump	And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media -- if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out.	0
311	Donald Trump	I probably wouldn't be standing here, right?	0
312	Donald Trump	I probably wouldn't be standing here right now.	0
313	Donald Trump	If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.	0
314	Donald Trump	And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, "He's in a Twitter-storm again!"	0
315	Donald Trump	I -- I don't do Twitter-storms.	0
316	Donald Trump	You know, you'll put out a little tweet: "I'm going to be with the veterans today."	0
317	Donald Trump	They'll say, "Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm."	0
318	Donald Trump	These are sick people.	0
319	Donald Trump	You know the thing I don't understand?	0
320	Donald Trump	You would think -- you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.	0
321	Donald Trump	I honestly believe it.	0
322	Donald Trump	If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth.	0
323	Donald Trump	I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.	0
324	Donald Trump	How about this?	0
325	Donald Trump	The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized.	1
326	Donald Trump	I would say they did.	0
327	Donald Trump	They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.	0
328	Donald Trump	Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled.	0
329	Donald Trump	And I figured, this is great.	0
330	Donald Trump	And for about two weeks I got good coverage.	0
331	Donald Trump	Then they reverted back into worse than ever before.	0
332	Donald Trump	You know, it's like one of those things.	0
333	Donald Trump	The Washington Post is terrible.	0
334	Donald Trump	But these are dishonest -- but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers.	0
335	Donald Trump	You have some great networks.	0
336	Donald Trump	I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.	0
337	Donald Trump	Fox treated me fairly.	0
338	Donald Trump	They've treated me fairly.	0
339	Donald Trump	Hey, I'll let you know.	0
340	Donald Trump	You know what?	0
341	Donald Trump	Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK?	0
342	Donald Trump	But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good.	0
343	Donald Trump	I get plenty of bad on Fox, too.	0
344	Donald Trump	But at least it's within reason.	0
345	Donald Trump	And Hannity?	0
346	Donald Trump	How good is that?	0
347	Donald Trump	How good is Hannity?	0
348	Donald Trump	And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy.	0
349	Donald Trump	And "Fox and Friends in the Morning" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch.	0
350	Donald Trump	Not only does -- oh boy, those cameras are going off.	0
351	Donald Trump	Oh, wow.	0
352	Donald Trump	Why don't you just fold them up and take them home?	0
353	Donald Trump	Oh, those cameras are going off.	0
354	Donald Trump	Wow.	0
355	Donald Trump	That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen.	0
356	Donald Trump	Now, you know what?	0
357	Donald Trump	I'm a person that wants to tell the truth.	0
358	Donald Trump	I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.	0
359	Donald Trump	Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.	0
360	Donald Trump	And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job.	0
361	Donald Trump	My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.	0
362	Donald Trump	We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe.	0
363	Donald Trump	And how safe are you at a Trump rally?	0
364	Donald Trump	Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started?	0
365	Donald Trump	When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs.	0
366	Donald Trump	They had -- our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.	0
367	Donald Trump	But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence.	0
368	Donald Trump	Let me tell you, see this room?	0
369	Donald Trump	You've got people outside, but not very many.	0
370	Donald Trump	But see this room?	0
371	Donald Trump	You're safe in this room.	0
372	Donald Trump	You're very safe in this room.	0
373	Donald Trump	It's a big room.	0
374	Donald Trump	The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.	0
375	Donald Trump	By the way, I'm just curious.	0
376	Donald Trump	Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?	0
377	Donald Trump	So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?	0
378	Donald Trump	That's why...	0
379	Donald Trump	He should have had a jury, but you know what?	0
380	Donald Trump	I'll make a prediction.	0
381	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be just fine, OK?	0
382	Donald Trump	But -- but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy.	0
383	Donald Trump	Is that OK?	0
384	Donald Trump	All right?	0
385	Donald Trump	But Sheriff Joe can feel good.	0
386	Donald Trump	The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.	0
387	Donald Trump	MS-13 -- we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this.	0
388	Donald Trump	We are liberating towns out on Long Island.	0
389	Donald Trump	We're liberating.	0
390	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, in this day and age -- in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns.	0
391	Donald Trump	This is like from a different age.	0
392	Donald Trump	We are taking these people.	0
393	Donald Trump	They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful.	0
394	Donald Trump	They cut them up into little pieces.	0
395	Donald Trump	These are animals.	0
396	Donald Trump	We are getting them out of here.	0
397	Donald Trump	We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country.	0
398	Donald Trump	We're liberating our towns.	0
399	Donald Trump	You're seen it.	0
400	Donald Trump	You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it.	0
401	Donald Trump	And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.	0
402	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.	0
403	Donald Trump	After years of defending other countries borders -- can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders -- we're finally defending our own borders.	0
404	Donald Trump	And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.	0
405	Donald Trump	And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in.	0
406	Donald Trump	We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country.	0
407	Donald Trump	Including the auto companies who are coming back.	0
408	Donald Trump	Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.	0
409	Donald Trump	While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country.	0
410	Donald Trump	We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.	0
411	Donald Trump	Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector.	0
412	Donald Trump	I was over at the Yuma Sector.	0
413	Donald Trump	It was hot.	0
414	Donald Trump	It was like 115 degrees.	0
415	Donald Trump	I'm out signing autographs for an hour.	0
416	Donald Trump	I was there.	0
417	Donald Trump	That was a hot day.	0
418	Donald Trump	You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me.	0
419	Donald Trump	And they actually told me -- actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.	0
420	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?	0
421	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
422	Donald Trump	But it was great.	0
423	Donald Trump	And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people; the job they do.	0
424	Donald Trump	And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.	1
425	Donald Trump	He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right?	0
426	Donald Trump	That made sense.	0
427	Donald Trump	John, where's John?	0
428	Donald Trump	Where is he?	0
429	Donald Trump	Where's General Kelly?	0
430	Donald Trump	Get him out here.	0
431	Donald Trump	He's great.	0
432	Donald Trump	He's doing a great job.	0
433	Donald Trump	But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot.	0
434	Donald Trump	We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.	0
435	Donald Trump	But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.	0
436	Donald Trump	All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws.	0
437	Donald Trump	And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.	0
438	Donald Trump	I promised them.	0
439	Donald Trump	I know so many of them.	0
440	Donald Trump	One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.	0
441	Donald Trump	We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail.	0
442	Donald Trump	We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally.	0
443	Donald Trump	And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary.	0
444	SYSTEM	[Crowd Chants Build that Wall]	0
445	Donald Trump	Build that wall.	0
446	Donald Trump	Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it.	0
447	Donald Trump	But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.	0
448	Donald Trump	Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: You are putting all of America's safety at risk.	0
449	Donald Trump	You're doing that.	0
450	Donald Trump	You're doing that.	0
451	Donald Trump	Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks?	0
452	Donald Trump	I met with a lot of them.	0
453	Donald Trump	And they looked at me, they said, it's vital.	0
454	Donald Trump	It's vital.	0
455	Donald Trump	It's so vital.	0
456	Donald Trump	And you know, we have walls.	0
457	Donald Trump	I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.	0
458	Donald Trump	And we want walls that you can see through in a sense.	0
459	Donald Trump	You want to see what's on the other side.	0
460	Donald Trump	But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.	0
461	Donald Trump	We've done a lot of work.	0
462	Donald Trump	But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls?	0
463	Donald Trump	And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.	0
464	Donald Trump	It is desperately needed.	0
465	Donald Trump	We're going to have our wall.	0
466	Donald Trump	We're going to get our wall.	0
467	Donald Trump	And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border.	0
468	Donald Trump	My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control.	0
469	Donald Trump	The American people voted for immigration control.	0
470	Donald Trump	That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it.	0
471	Donald Trump	So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall.	0
472	Donald Trump	Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.	0
473	Donald Trump	That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
474	Donald Trump	You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places.	0
475	Donald Trump	Nope.	0
476	Donald Trump	We're really vetting.	0
477	Donald Trump	We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like --	0
478	SYSTEM	[Crowd yells No]	0
479	Donald Trump	Extreme vetting -- I came up with that term.	0
480	Donald Trump	That's what it has to be.	0
481	Donald Trump	So I have a message for Congress tonight: You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers.	0
482	Donald Trump	That's your job.	0
483	Donald Trump	You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare -- one vote -- and on every other issue that affects their lives.	0
484	Donald Trump	And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy -- the Senate, remember this -- look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule; we have to.	0
485	Donald Trump	And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.	0
486	Donald Trump	You're wasting your time.	0
487	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of the filibuster rule.	0
488	Donald Trump	Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.	0
489	Donald Trump	That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation.	0
490	Donald Trump	We have over 200 bills.	0
491	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
492	Donald Trump	And we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.	0
493	Donald Trump	And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators.	0
494	Donald Trump	We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved.	0
495	Donald Trump	They fought.	0
496	Donald Trump	They really did.	0
497	Donald Trump	They really fought.	0
498	Donald Trump	Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.	0
499	Donald Trump	It's a trick.	0
500	Donald Trump	We needed 51 votes.	0
501	Donald Trump	But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.	0
502	Donald Trump	He's the greatest.	0
503	Donald Trump	But you have no margin.	0
504	Donald Trump	But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.	0
505	Donald Trump	So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines.	0
506	Donald Trump	One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates.	0
507	Donald Trump	It gives competition.	0
508	Donald Trump	Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down.	0
509	Donald Trump	Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest.	1
510	Donald Trump	You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.	0
511	Donald Trump	You've got to go to a majority.	0
512	Donald Trump	You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're -- they're just wasting time.	0
513	Donald Trump	All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.	0
514	Donald Trump	They do one thing well.	0
515	Donald Trump	You know what it's called?	0
516	Donald Trump	They have no ideas.	0
517	Donald Trump	They have no policies.	0
518	Donald Trump	They obstruct.	0
519	Donald Trump	That's all they do.	0
520	Donald Trump	They're word is, we resist.	0
521	Donald Trump	They don't resist; they obstruct.	0
522	Donald Trump	It's all they're good at.	0
523	Donald Trump	It's all they're good at.	0
524	Donald Trump	That's all they do.	0
525	Donald Trump	On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats.	0
526	Donald Trump	We got no votes.	0
527	Donald Trump	We got no votes.	0
528	Donald Trump	And it would have been great healthcare.	0
529	Donald Trump	And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.	0
530	Donald Trump	Would have been great.	0
531	Donald Trump	So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing.	0

602	Donald Trump	Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.	0

629	Donald Trump	You have a great governor.	0
630	Donald Trump	And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks.	0
631	Donald Trump	Where is Congressman Franks?	0
632	Donald Trump	Where is he?	0
633	Donald Trump	Get over here.	0
634	Donald Trump	Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs.	0
635	Donald Trump	Get up here, fellow.	0
636	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellows.	0

639	Donald Trump	Never let them go.	0
640	Donald Trump	Don't ever lose them.	0
641	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellows.	0
642	Donald Trump	So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK?	0
643	Donald Trump	For us.	0
644	Donald Trump	The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.	0
645	Donald Trump	We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp.	0
646	SYSTEM	[Booing]	0
647	Donald Trump	We need, right now, to drain the swamp.	0
648	Donald Trump	That's what's happening, too, believe me.	0
649	Donald Trump	Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.	0
650	Donald Trump	But I don't come to Washington for me.	0
651	Donald Trump	You know, I've had a great life.	0
652	Donald Trump	I've had great success.	0
653	Donald Trump	I've enjoyed my life.	0
654	Donald Trump	Most people think I'm crazy to have done this.	0
655	Donald Trump	And I think they're right.	0
656	Donald Trump	But I enjoy it, because we've made so much -- I don't believe that any president -- I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months.	0
657	Donald Trump	I really don't believe it.	0
658	Donald Trump	Including -- including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch. Big	0
659	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
660	Donald Trump	.	0
661	Donald Trump	I came to Washington for you.	0
662	Donald Trump	Your dreams are my dreams.	0
663	Donald Trump	Your hopes are my hopes.	0
664	Donald Trump	And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.	0
665	Donald Trump	It's so important.	0
666	Donald Trump	Our agenda is the pro-worker agenda.	0
667	Donald Trump	We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time.	0
668	Donald Trump	We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.	0
669	Donald Trump	They said we've signed none -- none.	0
670	Donald Trump	We've signed 50; appointed Justice Gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way.	0
671	Donald Trump	So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we're unleashing job-creating American energy like we've never unleashed before.	0
672	Donald Trump	We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal -- meaning, they're taking out coal.	0
673	Donald Trump	They're going to clean it -- is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one.	0
674	Donald Trump	And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.	0
675	Donald Trump	How about that?	0
676	Donald Trump	West Virginia.	0
677	Donald Trump	And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party.	0
678	Donald Trump	In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington -- please, don't take his statue down, please.	0
679	Donald Trump	Please.	0
680	Donald Trump	Does anybody want George Washington's statue?	0
681	Donald Trump	No.	0
682	Donald Trump	Is that sad?	0
683	Donald Trump	Is that all sad?	0
684	Donald Trump	To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.	0
685	Donald Trump	They're trying to figure out why.	0
686	Donald Trump	They don't know.	0
687	Donald Trump	They're trying to take away our culture.	0
688	Donald Trump	They are trying to take away our history.	0
689	Donald Trump	And our weak leaders, they do it overnight.	0
690	Donald Trump	These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.	0
691	Donald Trump	You go back to a university, and it's gone.	0
692	Donald Trump	Weak, weak people.	0
693	Donald Trump	We are going to protect American industry.	0
694	Donald Trump	We are going to protect the American worker.	0
695	Donald Trump	No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth.	0
696	Donald Trump	We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.	0
697	Donald Trump	We will buy American, and we will hire American.	0
698	Donald Trump	I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
699	Donald Trump	Would have been a disaster.	0
700	Donald Trump	And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into.	0
701	Donald Trump	We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA.	0
702	Donald Trump	And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.	0
703	Donald Trump	You have to see this.	0
704	Donald Trump	We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time.	0
705	Donald Trump	Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.	0
706	Donald Trump	Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer.	0
707	Donald Trump	Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal.	0
708	Donald Trump	So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK?	0
709	Donald Trump	Probably.	0
710	Donald Trump	But -- but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA.	0
711	Donald Trump	I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?	0
712	Donald Trump	You're in -- you're in good hands, I can tell you.	0
713	Donald Trump	We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
714	Donald Trump	People have no idea how bad that was for this country.	0
715	Donald Trump	Great for other countries.	0
716	Donald Trump	We were like the lap dog.	0
717	Donald Trump	Great for other countries.	0
718	Donald Trump	Our country was so behind.	0
719	Donald Trump	Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.	0
720	Donald Trump	Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low.	0
721	Donald Trump	Wages are rising.	0
722	Donald Trump	The stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.	0
723	Donald Trump	Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent.	0
724	Donald Trump	You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent.	0
725	Donald Trump	And we've just started.	0
726	Donald Trump	Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which -- and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation.	0
727	Donald Trump	Those regulations are unleashing our economy.	0
728	Donald Trump	So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent.	0
729	Donald Trump	Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent?	0
730	Donald Trump	We're already at 2.6.	0
731	Donald Trump	Maybe I'll have to increase my offer.	0
732	Donald Trump	And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council?	0
733	Donald Trump	When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.	0
734	Donald Trump	Not all of them, but some of them did.	0
735	Donald Trump	But I remember the ones that did.	0
736	Donald Trump	But they'll say, We take -- oh, we'll take -- but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass -- Don, can we get together for lunch?	0
737	Donald Trump	Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.	0
738	Donald Trump	These people just don't get it.	0
739	Donald Trump	They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately?	0
740	Donald Trump	They like it better.	0
741	Donald Trump	Why should they be on a council?	0
742	Donald Trump	You know, that's the way it is, folks.	0
743	Donald Trump	That's the way it is.	0
744	Donald Trump	To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years.	0
745	Donald Trump	Now, we need the help of Congress, please.	0
746	Donald Trump	OK?	0
747	Donald Trump	We need the help of Congress.	0
748	Donald Trump	And we really could use some Democrat help.	0
749	Donald Trump	We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.	0
750	Donald Trump	The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct.	0
751	Donald Trump	If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut.	0
752	Donald Trump	Just remember that, OK?	0
753	Donald Trump	America's crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound.	0
754	Donald Trump	We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country.	0
755	Donald Trump	That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America.	0
756	Donald Trump	We want more products stamped with the letters, "Made in the U.S.A.".	0
757	Donald Trump	We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money.	0
758	Donald Trump	So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side.	0
759	Donald Trump	Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.	0
760	Donald Trump	You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52.	0
761	Donald Trump	So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy.	0
762	Donald Trump	It's time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families.	0
763	Donald Trump	We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again.	0
764	Donald Trump	We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.	0
765	Donald Trump	We're going to do an infrastructure bill.	0
766	Donald Trump	We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land.	0
767	Donald Trump	Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life.	0
768	Donald Trump	American hands will build this future.	0
769	Donald Trump	American energy will power this future.	0
770	Donald Trump	We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently.	0
771	Donald Trump	And American workers will bring this future to life.	0
772	Donald Trump	We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism.	0
773	Donald Trump	We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything.	0
774	Donald Trump	It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.	0
775	Donald Trump	Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny.	0
776	Donald Trump	We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.	0
777	Donald Trump	As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.	0
778	Donald Trump	We are Americans, and the future belongs to us.	0
779	Donald Trump	The future belongs to all of you.	0
780	Donald Trump	This is our moment.	0
781	Donald Trump	This is our chance.	0
782	Donald Trump	This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America.	0
783	Donald Trump	Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.	0
784	Donald Trump	So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again.	0
785	Donald Trump	We will make America wealthy again.	0
786	Donald Trump	We will make America proud again.	0
787	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.	0
788	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.	0

792	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
