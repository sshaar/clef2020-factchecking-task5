1	Donald Trump	Hey, Michael.	0
2	Michael Scherer	Hey Mr. President, Thank you for taking the time.	0
3	Donald Trump	Absolutely.	0
4	Donald Trump	How have you been, OK?	0
5	Michael Scherer	Yeah, it has been a wild couple months.	0
6	Michael Scherer	You keep us busy.	0
7	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's been good though.	0
8	Donald Trump	It's been good. Do you want me to give you a quick overview	0
9	SYSTEM	[of the story]	0
10	Donald Trump	?	0
11	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's a cool story.	0
12	Donald Trump	I mean it's, the concept is right.	0
13	Donald Trump	I predicted a lot of things, Michael.	0
14	Donald Trump	Some things that came to you a little bit later.	0
15	Donald Trump	But, you know, we just rolled out a list.	0
16	Donald Trump	Sweden.	0
17	Donald Trump	I make the statement, everyone goes crazy .	0
18	Donald Trump	The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. Huma	1
19	SYSTEM	[Abedin]	1
20	Donald Trump	and Anthony	1
21	SYSTEM	[Weiner]	1
22	Donald Trump	, you know, what I tweeted about that whole deal, and then it turned out he had it, all of Hillary's email on his thing .	1
23	Donald Trump	NATO, obsolete , because it doesn't cover terrorism.	1
24	Donald Trump	They fixed that, and I said that the allies must pay.	1
25	Donald Trump	Nobody knew that they weren't paying.	0
26	Donald Trump	I did.	0
27	Donald Trump	I figured it.	0
28	Donald Trump	Brexit, I was totally right about that .	0
29	Donald Trump	You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before.	0
30	Donald Trump	Brussels, I said, Brussels is not Brussels.	0
31	Donald Trump	I mean many other things, the election's rigged against Bernie Sanders.	0
32	Donald Trump	We have a lot of things.	0
33	Michael Scherer	But there's other things you said that haven't panned out. The peg for this story is the wiretapping hearing on Monday, in which	0
34	SYSTEM	[FBI Director James]	0
35	Michael Scherer	Comey and	0
36	SYSTEM	[NSA Director Mike]	0
37	Michael Scherer	Rogers testified about your tweets there.	0
38	Donald Trump	Yeah well if you'd look at, in fact I'll give you the front page story, and just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference , did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping.	0
39	Donald Trump	Did you hear about that?	0
40	Michael Scherer	I have not, no.	0
41	Donald Trump	Now remember this.	0
42	Donald Trump	When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes.	0
43	Donald Trump	Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different than wire tapping.	0
44	Donald Trump	It is just a good description.	0
45	Donald Trump	But wiretapping was in quotes.	0
46	Donald Trump	What I'm talking about is surveillance. And today,	0
47	SYSTEM	[House Intelligence Committee Chairman]	0
48	Donald Trump	Devin Nunes just had a news conference.	0
49	Donald Trump	Now probably got obliterated by what's happened in London .	0
50	Donald Trump	But just had a news conference, and here it is one of those things.	0
51	Donald Trump	The other one, election, I said we are going to win, we won.	0
52	Donald Trump	And many other things.	0
53	Donald Trump	And I think this is going to be very interesting.	0
54	Michael Scherer	So you don't feel like Comey's testimony in any way takes away from the credibility of the tweets you put out, even with the quotes?	0
55	Donald Trump	No, I have, look.	0
56	Donald Trump	I have articles saying it happened.	0
57	Donald Trump	But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference.	0
58	Donald Trump	Devin Nunes had a news conference.	0
59	Donald Trump	I mean I don't know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance.	0
60	Donald Trump	Now again, it is in quotes.	0
61	Donald Trump	That means surveillance and various other things.	0
62	Donald Trump	And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping.	0
63	Donald Trump	And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time.	0
64	Donald Trump	We will see what happens.	0
65	Donald Trump	Look.	0
66	Donald Trump	I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of Time.	0
67	Donald Trump	Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times , "Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides."	1
68	Donald Trump	That's a headline.	0
69	Donald Trump	Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning.	0
70	Donald Trump	They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap.	0
71	Donald Trump	Wiretapped data used in inquiry.	0
72	Donald Trump	Then changed after that, they probably didn't like it.	0
73	Donald Trump	And they changed the title.	0
74	Donald Trump	They took the wiretap word out.	0
75	Michael Scherer	One of my ideas here is that throughout the campaign and now as president, you have used disputed statements, this is one of them that is disputed, the claim that three million undocumented people voted in the election...	1
76	Donald Trump	Well I think I will be proved right about that too.	0
77	Michael Scherer	The claim that Muslims celebrated on 9-11 in New Jersey...	1
78	Donald Trump	Well if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post .	0
79	Michael Scherer	But my idea is that whatever the reality of what you are describing, the fact that they are disputed makes them a more effective message, that you are able to spread the message further, that more people get excited about it, that it gets on TV.	0
80	Donald Trump	Well now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally.	0
81	Donald Trump	And they then vote.	0
82	Donald Trump	You have tremendous numbers of people.	0
83	Donald Trump	In fact I'm forming a committee on it.	0
84	Michael Scherer	But there's no evidence that 3 million people voted with...	0
85	Donald Trump	We'll see after the committee.	0
86	Donald Trump	I have people say it was more than that.	0
87	Donald Trump	We will see after we have.	0
88	Donald Trump	But there will be, we are forming a committee.	0
89	Donald Trump	And we are going to do a study on it, a very serious problem.	0
90	Michael Scherer	Is there anything different about making these kinds of predictions without having the factual evidence as President?	0
91	Donald Trump	I'm a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right.	0
92	Donald Trump	When everyone said I wasn't going to win the election, I said well I think I would.	0
93	Donald Trump	You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, the New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down at one percent, well, I said no I think I am going to win, and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed , you remember.	0
94	Donald Trump	He thought it was very cute, and very funny.	0
95	Donald Trump	Other people smiled.	0
96	Donald Trump	And some people, the smart people or the people that know me didn't laugh at all.	0
97	Donald Trump	There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn't laugh at all, they thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me.	0
98	Donald Trump	They get it.	0
99	Donald Trump	But you take a look and guess what, I won, and I won easily.	0
100	Donald Trump	I predicted Brexit.	0
101	Donald Trump	Remember they said there was no way to get to 270?	0
102	Donald Trump	Well I ended up at 306.	0
103	Donald Trump	I had election night, 306.	0
104	Donald Trump	But there was no way to get to, in fact I went to Maine four times, four times I went to Maine, because I had to get one vote, because there was no way to get to 270, but I ended up getting to 306.	0
105	Donald Trump	Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event.	0
106	Donald Trump	I said, no, Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened.	0
107	Donald Trump	Many many things.	0
108	Donald Trump	They turn out to be right.	0
109	Donald Trump	And now today, Devin Nunes, just had a news conference.	0
110	Michael Scherer	I'll look that up.	0
111	Donald Trump	Yeah, just had it.	0
112	Donald Trump	Now the problem, the thing is, I'm not sure they are watching anything other than that, let's see members of Donald Trump transition team, possibly, oh this just came out.	0
113	Donald Trump	This is a Politico story .	0
114	Donald Trump	Members of the Donald Trump Transition team possibly including Trump himself were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November's election.	0
115	Donald Trump	House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow.	0
116	Donald Trump	Nunes said, so that means I'm right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been ... incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.	0
117	Michael Scherer	But so incidental collection would not be wiretapping of you, it would be wiretapping of...	0
118	Donald Trump	Who knows what it is?	0
119	Donald Trump	You know, why, because somebody says incidental.	0
120	Donald Trump	Nunes is going to the White House.	0
121	Michael Scherer	Nunes has also said that he has no evidence that your tweet was right, previously.	0
122	Donald Trump	Well, he just got this information.	0
123	Donald Trump	This was new information.	0
124	Donald Trump	That was just got.	0
125	Donald Trump	Members, of, let's see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November's election.	0
126	Donald Trump	Wow.	0
127	Donald Trump	This just came out.	0
128	Donald Trump	So, ah, just came out.	0
129	Michael Scherer	Mitch McConnell has said he'd rather you stop tweeting , that he sees it as a distraction.	0
130	Donald Trump	Mitch will speak for himself.	0
131	Donald Trump	Mitch is a wonderful man.	0
132	Donald Trump	Mitch should speak for himself.	0
133	Michael Scherer	But you don't see any problems caused by these kinds of controversies.	0
134	Michael Scherer	Does this, when we are talking in the press about whether the president was wiretapped or not, is this good for you or bad for you?	0
135	Donald Trump	Probably neither.	0
136	Donald Trump	Probably neither.	0
137	Donald Trump	What I said, look I said, Donna Brazile had information , and she had information on Hillary's debate questions.	0
138	Donald Trump	I said why didn't Hillary apologize.	0
139	Donald Trump	Donna Brazile just admitted that that was right.	0
140	Donald Trump	I said the election was rigged against Bernie, a lot of people agree with that one, a lot of people hated the statement when I made it.	0
141	Michael Scherer	But I grant you some of those.	0
142	Michael Scherer	But you would agree also that some of the things you have said haven't been true.	0
143	Michael Scherer	You say that Ted Cruz's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald .	0
144	Donald Trump	Well that was in a newspaper.	0
145	Donald Trump	No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he's a friend of mine.	0
146	Donald Trump	But that was in the newspaper.	0
147	Donald Trump	I wasn't, I didn't say that.	0
148	Donald Trump	I was referring to a newspaper.	0
149	Donald Trump	A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.	1
150	Michael Scherer	That gets close to the heart...	0
151	Donald Trump	Why do you say that I have to apologize?	0
152	Donald Trump	I'm just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano , just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap.	0
153	Donald Trump	Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know.	0
154	Donald Trump	But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term.	0
155	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right.	0
156	Donald Trump	I don't know where he has gone with it since then.	0
157	Donald Trump	But I'm quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks.	0
158	Michael Scherer	But traditionally people in your position in the Oval Office have not said things unless they can verify they are true.	0
159	Donald Trump	Well, I'm not, well, I think, I'm not saying, I'm quoting, Michael, I'm quoting highly respected people and sources from major television networks.	0
160	Michael Scherer	Did you see the Wall Street Journal opinion page today , the editorial page?	0
161	Donald Trump	I thought it was, I thought it was a disgrace that they could write that.	0
162	Michael Scherer	But let me just, the hypothetical they started with, you have to announce to the country or to the world that some serious national security event has happened, and...	0
163	Donald Trump	The country believes me.	0
164	Donald Trump	Hey.	0
165	Donald Trump	I went to Kentucky two nights ago , we had 25,000 people in a massive basketball arena.	0
166	Donald Trump	There wasn't a seat, they had to send away people.	0
167	Donald Trump	I went to Tennessee four nights ago.	0
168	Donald Trump	We had a packed house, they had to send away thousands of people.	0
169	Donald Trump	You saw that, right.	0
170	Donald Trump	Did you see that?	0
171	Michael Scherer	Yes I did.	0
172	Donald Trump	The country's not buying it, it is fake media.	0
173	Donald Trump	And the Wall Street Journal is a part of it.	0
174	Michael Scherer	Ok.	0
175	Michael Scherer	So you don't worry that your credibility, that if you've cited things that later turn out to be wrong, based on anonymous sources that that hurts you.	0
176	Donald Trump	Name what's wrong!	0
177	Donald Trump	I mean, honestly.	0
178	Michael Scherer	Fox News said...	0
179	Donald Trump	Brexit.	0
180	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.	0
181	Donald Trump	I predicted Brexit.	0
182	Donald Trump	What I said about NATO was true, people aren't paying their bills.	0
183	Donald Trump	And everyone said it was a horrible thing to say.	0
184	Donald Trump	And then they found out.	0
185	Donald Trump	And when Germany was over here I said, we are going to have a great relationship with Germany but you have to pay your NATO bills, and they don't even dispute it, ok.	1
186	Donald Trump	So what have I said that is wrong?	0
187	Donald Trump	Everyone, I got attacked on NATO and now they are all saying I was right.	0
188	Donald Trump	I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that.	0
189	Donald Trump	I took a lot of heat when I said Brexit was going to pass.	0
190	Donald Trump	Don't forget, Obama said that U.K. will go to the back of the line, and I talked about Sweden, and may have been somewhat different, but the following day, two days later, they had a massive riot in Sweden, exactly what I was talking about, I was right about that.	0
191	Michael Scherer	But even in that Sweden quote, you said look at what happened on Friday in Sweden.	0
192	Michael Scherer	But you are now saying you were referring to something that happened the following day.	0
193	Donald Trump	No I am saying I was right.	0
194	Donald Trump	I am talking about Sweden.	0
195	Donald Trump	I'm talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about.	0
196	Donald Trump	That is what I am talking about.	0
197	Donald Trump	You can phrase it any way you want.	0
198	Donald Trump	A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened.	0
199	Donald Trump	I talked about Brussels.	0
200	Donald Trump	I was on the front page of the New York Times for my quote.	0
201	Donald Trump	I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels.	0
202	Donald Trump	I was absolutely lambasted.	0
203	Donald Trump	A short Time later they had the major attack in Brussels.	0
204	Donald Trump	One year ago today.	0
205	Donald Trump	Exactly one year ago today.	0
206	Donald Trump	And then people said you know Trump was right.	0
207	Donald Trump	What am I going to tell you?	0
208	Donald Trump	I tend to be right.	0
209	Donald Trump	I'm an instinctual person, I happen to be a person that knows how life works.	0
210	Donald Trump	I said I was going to win the election, I won the election, in fact I was number one the entire route, in the primaries, from the day I announced, I was number one.	0
211	Donald Trump	And the New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win.	0
212	Donald Trump	We thought we were going to win the night of the election.	0
213	Michael Scherer	So when you...	0
214	Donald Trump	And then Time magazine, which treats me horribly, but obviously I sell, I assume this is going to be a cover too, have I set the record?	0
215	Donald Trump	I guess, right?	0
216	Donald Trump	Covers, nobody's had more covers.	0
217	Michael Scherer	I think Richard Nixon still has you beat .	0
218	Michael Scherer	But he was in office for longer, so give yourself time.	0
219	Donald Trump	Ok good.	0
220	Donald Trump	I'm sure I'll win.	0
221	Michael Scherer	If you go back to Comey testifying that he and the Justice Department have no information to back up your tweet, the head of the NSA testifying that there is no information to back up your tweet, or the claim made by Judge Napolitano...	0
222	Donald Trump	On front page of the New York Times , OK?	0
223	Donald Trump	It's in the title of the front page. And I would like you to officially I know you are going to write a bad article because you always do	0
224	SYSTEM	[mention]	0
225	Donald Trump	wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides.	0
226	Donald Trump	OK. Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aids.	0
227	Donald Trump	Ok?	0
228	Donald Trump	Can you possibly put that down?	0
229	Donald Trump	Front page, January 20th.	0
230	Donald Trump	Now in their second editions, they took it all down under the internet.	0
231	Donald Trump	They took that out.	0
232	Donald Trump	Ok?	0
233	Donald Trump	But that's the way it is.	0
234	Donald Trump	And then they just had a news conference now where they turned out, you watch.	0
235	Donald Trump	You watch.	0
236	Michael Scherer	That is different...	0
237	Donald Trump	I'm not criticizing anybody, I'm just saying.	0
238	Michael Scherer	That is different that the president wiretapping you which would be a crime outside of a court.	0
239	Donald Trump	Well I don't know where these wiretaps came from.	0
240	Donald Trump	They came from someplace.	0
241	Donald Trump	That is what they should find out.	0
242	Donald Trump	And you know the real story here is about the leakers.	0
243	Donald Trump	OK?	0
244	Donald Trump	You don't write about that.	0
245	Donald Trump	But the real story here is, who released General Flynn's name?	0
246	Donald Trump	Who released, who released my conversations with Australia, and who released my conversation with Mexico?	0
247	Donald Trump	To me, Michael, that's the story, these leakers, they are disgusting.	0
248	Donald Trump	These are horrible people.	0
249	Michael Scherer	And apparently there is an investigation into that as well.	0
250	Donald Trump	Well should be, because that's where the whole, who would think that you are speaking to the head of Mexico, the head of Australia, or General Flynn, who was, they are not supposed to release that.	0
251	Donald Trump	That is the most confidential stuff.	0
252	Donald Trump	Classified.	0
253	Donald Trump	That's classified.	0
254	Donald Trump	You go to prison when you release stuff like that.	0
255	Donald Trump	And who would release that?	0
256	Donald Trump	The real story is, they have to work, intelligence has to work on finding out who are the leakers.	0
257	Donald Trump	Because you know what?	0
258	Donald Trump	When things get involved with North Korea and all the problems we have there, in the Middle East, I mean, that information cannot be leaked out, and it will be by this, this same, and these people were here in the Obama years, because he had plenty of leakers also.	0
259	Donald Trump	But intelligence has to find out, who are these people.	0
260	Donald Trump	Because the biggest story here is, who is leaking this classified information.	0
261	Michael Scherer	But isn't there, it strikes me there is still an issue of credibility.	0
262	Michael Scherer	If the intelligence community came out and said, we have determined that so and so is the leaker here, but you are saying to me now, that you don't believe the intelligence community when they say your tweet was wrong.	0
263	Donald Trump	I'm not saying no, I'm not blaming.	0
264	Donald Trump	First of all, I put Mike Pompeo in.	0
265	Donald Trump	I put Senator Dan Coats in.	0
266	Donald Trump	These are great people.	0
267	Donald Trump	I think they are great people and they are going to, I have a lot of confidence in them.	0
268	Donald Trump	So hopefully things will straighten out.	0
269	Donald Trump	But I inherited a mess, I inherited a mess in so many ways.	0
270	Donald Trump	I inherited a mess in the Middle East, and a mess with North Korea, I inherited a mess with jobs, despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can't get a job, ok. And I inherited a mess on trade.	1
271	Donald Trump	I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder.	0
272	Donald Trump	But that's the story.	0
273	Donald Trump	Hey look, in the mean Time, I guess, I can't be doing so badly, because I'm president, and you're not.	0
274	Donald Trump	You know.	0
275	Donald Trump	Say hello to everybody OK?	0
276	Michael Scherer	Thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
