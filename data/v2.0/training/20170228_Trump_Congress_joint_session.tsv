1	Donald Trump	Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States...	0
2	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
3	Donald Trump	...and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats...	0
4	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
5	Donald Trump	Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.	0
6	Donald Trump	Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.	0
7	Donald Trump	That torch is now in our hands.	0
8	Donald Trump	And we will use it to light up the world.	0
9	Donald Trump	I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter...	0
10	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
11	Donald Trump	...of American greatness is now beginning.	0
12	Donald Trump	A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.	0
13	Donald Trump	And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.	0
14	Donald Trump	What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.	0
15	Donald Trump	Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.	0
16	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
17	Donald Trump	All the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.	0
18	Donald Trump	In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence.	0
19	Donald Trump	It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.	0
20	Donald Trump	But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?	0
21	Donald Trump	What kind of country will we leave for our children?	0
22	Donald Trump	I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.	0
23	Donald Trump	For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.	0
24	Donald Trump	We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.	0
25	Donald Trump	We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross	0
26	SYSTEM	[Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well. ]	0
27	Donald Trump	, and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.	0
28	Donald Trump	And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.	0
29	Donald Trump	Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.	0
30	Donald Trump	The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.	0
31	Donald Trump	But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.	0
32	Donald Trump	Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.	0
33	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
34	Donald Trump	Dying industries will come roaring back to life.	0
35	Donald Trump	Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.	0
36	Donald Trump	Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.	0
37	Donald Trump	Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.	0
38	Donald Trump	Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop.	0
39	Donald Trump	And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.	0
40	Donald Trump	Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.	0
41	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
42	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
43	Donald Trump	It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.	0
44	Donald Trump	Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.	0
45	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
46	Donald Trump	The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record.	0
47	Donald Trump	We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.	1
48	Donald Trump	We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials — and a lifetime ban...	0
49	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
50	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
51	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
52	Donald Trump	And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency...	0
53	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
54	Donald Trump	... and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
55	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0

63	Donald Trump	And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.	0
64	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
65	Donald Trump	We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
66	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
67	Donald Trump	And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.	0
68	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
69	Donald Trump	To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime.	0
70	Donald Trump	I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.	0
71	SYSTEM	[Fact check: True, but they don't do much.]	0
72	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
73	Donald Trump	We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.	0
74	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
75	Donald Trump	At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.	0
76	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
77	Donald Trump	By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages	1

80	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
81	Donald Trump	We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.	1
82	Donald Trump	We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.	0
83	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
84	Donald Trump	For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.	0
85	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
86	Donald Trump	As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.	1
87	SYSTEM	[Fact check: Not a big change.]	1
88	Donald Trump	Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.	1
89	Donald Trump	To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?	0
90	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
91	Donald Trump	Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States.	0
92	Donald Trump	We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.	0
93	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
94	Donald Trump	According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.	0
95	Donald Trump	We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center.	0
96	Donald Trump	We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.	0
97	Donald Trump	It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.	0
98	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
99	Donald Trump	Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.	0
100	Donald Trump	We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.	0
101	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
102	Donald Trump	That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.	0
103	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
104	Donald Trump	As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.	0
105	Donald Trump	We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.	0
106	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
107	Donald Trump	I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.	0
108	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
109	Donald Trump	Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.	0

111	Donald Trump	I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.	0
112	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
113	Donald Trump	Thank you, Maureen.	0
114	Donald Trump	Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.	0
115	Donald Trump	To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.	0
116	Donald Trump	He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.	0
117	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
118	Donald Trump	Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.	0
119	Donald Trump	Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.	0
120	SYSTEM	[Fact check: This is misleading.]	0
121	Donald Trump	Over 43 million people are now living in poverty.	0
122	SYSTEM	[Fact check: True — but the number has also fallen.]	0
123	Donald Trump	And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.	0
124	SYSTEM	[Fact check: The number is correct.]	0
125	Donald Trump	More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.	0
126	Donald Trump	We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.	0
127	Donald Trump	In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.	0
128	Donald Trump	We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved	0
129	SYSTEM	[Fact check: Not because of Nafta. ]	0
130	Donald Trump	, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.	0
131	Donald Trump	Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.	0
132	Donald Trump	And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.	0
133	Donald Trump	Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.	0
134	Donald Trump	It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.	0
135	Donald Trump	But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.	0
136	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
137	Donald Trump	Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.	1
138	Donald Trump	My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.	0
139	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
140	Donald Trump	It will be a big, big cut.	0
141	Donald Trump	At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.	0
142	Donald Trump	We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers — have to do it.	0
143	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
144	Donald Trump	Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.	0
145	Donald Trump	I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.	0
146	Donald Trump	In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.	0
147	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
148	Donald Trump	And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, "No, thank you."	0
149	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
150	Donald Trump	At our meeting, I asked them, "How are you doing?	0
151	Donald Trump	How is business?"	0
152	Donald Trump	They said that it's good.	0
153	Donald Trump	I asked them further, "How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?"	0
154	Donald Trump	They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it — that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate.	0
155	Donald Trump	They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.	0
156	Donald Trump	They weren't even asking for a change.	0
157	Donald Trump	But I am. I believe...	0
158	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
159	Donald Trump	I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.	0
160	Donald Trump	It's been a long time since we had fair trade.	0
161	Donald Trump	The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that "the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."	0
162	Donald Trump	Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.	0
163	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
164	Donald Trump	I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken — advantage of us any longer.	0
165	Donald Trump	They have taken advantage of our country no longer.	0
166	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
167	Donald Trump	I am going to bring back millions of jobs.	0
168	Donald Trump	Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.	0
169	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
170	Donald Trump	The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.	0
171	Donald Trump	Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.	0
172	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
173	Donald Trump	It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.	0
174	Donald Trump	Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.	0
175	Donald Trump	According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.	0
176	SYSTEM	[Fact check: This needs context.]	0
177	Donald Trump	Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.	0
178	Donald Trump	It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class.	0
179	Donald Trump	And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.	0
180	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
181	Donald Trump	I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.	0
182	Donald Trump	If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.	0
183	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
184	Donald Trump	Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system.	0
185	Donald Trump	The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.	0
186	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
187	Donald Trump	America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.	1
188	Donald Trump	With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.	0
189	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
190	Donald Trump	To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.	0
191	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
192	Donald Trump	This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.	0
193	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
194	Donald Trump	Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare...	0
195	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
196	Donald Trump	... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.	0
197	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
198	Donald Trump	Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.	0
199	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
200	Donald Trump	The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.	0
201	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
202	Donald Trump	Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.	1
203	SYSTEM	[Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.]	1
204	Donald Trump	As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.	0
205	Donald Trump	Gov.	0
206	Donald Trump	Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.	1
207	Donald Trump	One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast.	0
208	Donald Trump	They're leaving.	0
209	Donald Trump	And many Americans have no choice at all.	0
210	Donald Trump	There's no choice left.	0
211	Donald Trump	Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?	0
212	Donald Trump	We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.	0
213	Donald Trump	Obamacare is collapsing	1
214	SYSTEM	[Fact check: This is an exaggeration. ]	1
215	Donald Trump	, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.	1
216	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
217	Donald Trump	Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.	0
218	Donald Trump	So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.	0
219	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
220	Donald Trump	Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.	0
221	Donald Trump	First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.	0
222	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
223	Donald Trump	Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.	0
224	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
225	Donald Trump	Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.	0
226	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
227	Donald Trump	Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.	0
228	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
229	Donald Trump	And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines...	0
230	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
231	Donald Trump	... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.	0
232	Donald Trump	So important.	0
233	Donald Trump	Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.	0
234	Donald Trump	Every problem can be solved.	0
235	Donald Trump	And every hurting family can find healing and hope.	0
236	Donald Trump	Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?	0
237	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
238	Donald Trump	On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.	0
239	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
240	Donald Trump	My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave...	0
241	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
242	Donald Trump	... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.	0
243	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
244	Donald Trump	True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.	0
245	Donald Trump	An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.	0
246	Donald Trump	Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan...	0
247	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
248	Donald Trump	Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.	0
249	Donald Trump	She was not expected to live past 5.	0
250	Donald Trump	On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.	0
251	Donald Trump	He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.	0
252	Donald Trump	Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.	0
253	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
254	Donald Trump	Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.	0
255	Donald Trump	But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.	0
256	Donald Trump	If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A.	0
257	Donald Trump	but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.	0
258	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
259	Donald Trump	In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.	0
260	Donald Trump	But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind — and the souls — of every American child.	0
261	Donald Trump	Education is the civil rights issue of our time.	0
262	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
263	Donald Trump	I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.	0
264	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
265	Donald Trump	These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.	0

267	Donald Trump	Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.	0
268	Donald Trump	As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.	0
269	Donald Trump	But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.	0
270	Donald Trump	Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.	0
271	Donald Trump	Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work.	0
272	Donald Trump	We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.	0
273	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
274	Donald Trump	But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.	0
275	Donald Trump	The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.	0
276	SYSTEM	[Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.]	0
277	Donald Trump	In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.	0
278	Donald Trump	This is not acceptable in our society.	0
279	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
280	Donald Trump	Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.	0
281	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
282	Donald Trump	But to create this future, we must work with — not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement.	0
283	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
284	Donald Trump	We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's — really, it's what it is, division.	0
285	Donald Trump	It's pure, unadulterated division.	0
286	Donald Trump	We have to unify.	0
287	Donald Trump	Police and sheriffs are members of our community.	0
288	Donald Trump	They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.	0
289	Donald Trump	We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.	0
290	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
291	Donald Trump	And we must support the victims of crime.	0
292	Donald Trump	I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.	0

298	Donald Trump	Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis.	0
299	Donald Trump	Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.	0
300	Donald Trump	Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.	0
301	Donald Trump	But he never got the chance.	0
302	Donald Trump	His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.	0
303	Donald Trump	Jamiel, thank you.	0
304	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0

307	Donald Trump	Their husbands — Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis — were slain in the line of duty in California.	0
308	Donald Trump	They were pillars of their community.	0
309	Donald Trump	These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.	0
310	Donald Trump	Should have never been in our country.	0
311	Donald Trump	Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.	0

316	Donald Trump	We will always honor their memory.	0
317	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
318	Donald Trump	Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win.	1
319	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
320	Donald Trump	I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...	1
321	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
322	Donald Trump	... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.	1
323	Donald Trump	My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.	0
324	Donald Trump	Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.	0
325	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
326	Donald Trump	The challenges we face as a nation are great.	0
327	Donald Trump	But our people are even greater.	0
328	Donald Trump	And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.	0
329	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
330	Donald Trump	We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens.	0
331	Donald Trump	Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.	0
332	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
333	Donald Trump	I just spoke to our great General	0
334	SYSTEM	[Jim]	0
335	Donald Trump	Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy."	0
336	Donald Trump	Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.	0
337	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
338	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
339	Donald Trump	And Ryan is looking down right now.	0
340	Donald Trump	You know that.	0
341	Donald Trump	And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.	0
342	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
343	Donald Trump	For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.	0
344	Donald Trump	Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom.	0
345	Donald Trump	And we will never forget Ryan.	0
346	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
347	Donald Trump	To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.	0
348	Donald Trump	Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.	0
349	Donald Trump	It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism...	1
350	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
351	Donald Trump	... and a Cold War and defeated communism.	1
352	SYSTEM	[Applause]	1
353	Donald Trump	But our partners must meet their financial obligations.	1
354	Donald Trump	And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.	0
355	Donald Trump	In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in.	0
356	Donald Trump	Very nice.	0
357	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
358	Donald Trump	We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost — have to do that.	0
359	Donald Trump	We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations.	0
360	Donald Trump	And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.	0
361	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
362	Donald Trump	Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.	0
363	Donald Trump	My job is not to represent the world.	0
364	Donald Trump	My job is to represent the United States of America.	0
365	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
366	Donald Trump	But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.	0
367	Donald Trump	We must learn from the mistakes of the past.	0
368	Donald Trump	We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.	0
369	Donald Trump	All across the world.	0
370	Donald Trump	The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.	0
371	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
372	Donald Trump	America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.	0
373	Donald Trump	We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.	0
374	Donald Trump	We want peace, wherever peace can be found.	0
375	Donald Trump	America is friends today with former enemies.	0
376	Donald Trump	Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.	0
377	Donald Trump	This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.	0
378	Donald Trump	Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.	0
379	Donald Trump	On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.	0
380	Donald Trump	At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.	0
381	Donald Trump	Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.	0
382	Donald Trump	Remington unveiled the first typewriter.	0
383	Donald Trump	An early attempt was made at electric light.	0
384	Donald Trump	Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.	0
385	Donald Trump	Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.	0
386	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
387	Donald Trump	Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.	0
388	Donald Trump	Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.	0
389	Donald Trump	American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.	0
390	Donald Trump	Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.	0
391	Donald Trump	And streets where mothers are safe from fear — schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow — are not too much to ask.	0
392	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
393	Donald Trump	When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans.	0
394	Donald Trump	This is our vision.	0
395	Donald Trump	This is our mission.	0
396	Donald Trump	But we can only get there together.	0
397	Donald Trump	We are one people, with one destiny.	0
398	Donald Trump	We all bleed the same blood.	0
399	Donald Trump	We all salute the same great American flag.	0
400	Donald Trump	And we are all made by the same God.	0
401	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
402	Donald Trump	When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.	0
403	Donald Trump	The time for small thinking is over.	0
404	Donald Trump	The time for trivial fights is behind us.	0
405	Donald Trump	We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.	0
406	Donald Trump	From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.	0
407	Donald Trump	I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.	0
408	Donald Trump	I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.	0
409	Donald Trump	I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.	0
410	Donald Trump	Believe in yourselves.	0
411	Donald Trump	Believe in your future.	0
412	Donald Trump	And believe, once more, in America.	0
413	Donald Trump	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.	0
