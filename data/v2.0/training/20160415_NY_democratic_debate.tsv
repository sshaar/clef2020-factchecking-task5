1	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules.	0
2	BLITZER	As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups.	0
3	BLITZER	You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis.	0
4	BLITZER	You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups.	0
5	BLITZER	Timing lights will signal when your time is up.	0
6	BLITZER	Both candidates have agreed to these rules now.	0
7	BLITZER	Opening statements, you'll each have two minutes.	0
8	BLITZER	Let's begin with Senator Sanders.	0
9	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10	SANDERS	Wolf, thank you very much.	0
11	SANDERS	CNN, thank you very much.	0
12	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.	0
13	SANDERS	When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls.	0
14	SANDERS	We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton.	0
15	SANDERS	In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.	0
16	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
17	SANDERS	Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.	0
18	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
19	SANDERS	Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.	0
20	SANDERS	The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.	0
21	SANDERS	And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...	0
22	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
23	SANDERS	... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.	0
24	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
25	SANDERS	This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
26	SANDERS	Thank you.	0
27	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?	0
28	CLINTON	Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...	0
29	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
30	SANDERS	... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.	0
31	SANDERS	I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...	0
32	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
33	SANDERS	... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.	0
34	SANDERS	And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.	0
35	SANDERS	We faced 9/11.	0
36	SANDERS	We worked hard to rebuild New York.	0
37	SANDERS	I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.	0
38	SANDERS	We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.	0
39	SANDERS	And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.	0
40	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
41	SANDERS	And that is -- that is exactly what I want to do as your president.	0
42	SANDERS	We will celebrate our diversity.	0
43	SANDERS	We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.	0
44	SANDERS	That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential.	0
45	SANDERS	That is what my campaign is about.	0
46	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
47	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
48	BLITZER	We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.	0
49	BLITZER	I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.	0
50	BLITZER	Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president.	0
51	BLITZER	You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.	0
52	BLITZER	So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?	0
53	SANDERS	Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?	0
54	SANDERS	We worked together in the Senate.	0
55	SANDERS	And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign.	0
56	SANDERS	Washington Post headline says "Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified" and that's what the surrogates were saying.	0
57	SANDERS	Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?	0
58	SANDERS	Of course she does.	0
59	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
60	SANDERS	But I do question...	0
61	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
62	SANDERS	-- but I do question her judgment.	0
63	SANDERS	I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...	0
64	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
65	SANDERS	-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.	0
66	SANDERS	And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.	0
67	SANDERS	I don't believe that that is...	0
68	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
69	SANDERS	-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.	0
70	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?	0
71	CLINTON	Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.	0
72	CLINTON	I've been called a lot of things in my life.	0
73	CLINTON	That was a first.	0
74	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
75	CLINTON	And then he did say that...	0
76	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
77	CLINTON	-- he had to question my judgment.	0
78	CLINTON	Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...	0
79	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
80	CLINTON	-- and...	0
81	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
82	CLINTON	-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.	0
83	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
84	CLINTON	So, look, we have disagreements on policy.	0
85	CLINTON	There's no doubt about it.	0
86	CLINTON	But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the "New York Daily News," talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.	0
87	CLINTON	When asked, he could not explain how...	0
88	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
89	CLINTON	-- that would be done and...	0
90	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
91	CLINTON	-- when asked...	0
92	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
93	CLINTON	-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.	0
94	CLINTON	I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.	0
95	BLITZER	Senator...	0
96	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
97	SANDERS	And let's talk about judgment.	0
98	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Yes!	0
99	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
100	SANDERS	And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...	0
101	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
102	SANDERS	I led the opposition to that war.	0
103	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton voted for that.	0
104	SANDERS	Well, let's talk about judgment.	0
105	SANDERS	Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.	0
106	SANDERS	Where does the money come from?	0
107	SANDERS	Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?	0
108	SANDERS	I don't think so.	0
109	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
110	CLINTON	Well, let me...	0
111	SANDERS	We have...	0
112	CLINTON	-- let me just say...	0
113	SANDERS	-- (INAUDIBLE)...	0
114	CLINTON	-- let me -- let me say...	0
115	BLITZER	Madam Secretary, let him finish.	0
116	CLINTON	OK.	0
117	SANDERS	Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.	0
118	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
119	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
120	SANDERS	We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people.	0
121	SANDERS	So I...	0
122	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
123	SANDERS	-- my (INAUDIBLE).	0
124	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
125	BLITZER	Secretary?	0
126	CLINTON	Well, make -- make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.	0
127	CLINTON	President Obama...	0
128	SYSTEM	(BOOS)	0
129	CLINTON	You know, let me tell you why.	0
130	CLINTON	You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.	0
131	CLINTON	President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.	0
132	CLINTON	President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.	0
133	CLINTON	And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...	0
134	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
135	CLINTON	-- on Wall Street in many a year.	0
136	CLINTON	So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.	0
137	BLITZER	Thank, Secretary.	0
138	BLITZER	We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.	0
139	BASH	Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.	0
140	BASH	This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.	0
141	BASH	So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?	0
142	BASH	Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?	0
143	CLINTON	Absolutely.	0
144	CLINTON	You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.	0
145	CLINTON	No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.	0
146	CLINTON	I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.	0
147	CLINTON	I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.	0
148	CLINTON	I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.	0
149	CLINTON	There are two sections there.	0
150	CLINTON	If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.	0
151	CLINTON	Let's look at what is at stake here.	0
152	CLINTON	We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.	0
153	CLINTON	I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.	0
154	CLINTON	I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.	0
155	CLINTON	We've got to execute under it.	0
156	CLINTON	So, you're right.	0
157	CLINTON	I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.	0
158	CLINTON	The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...	0
159	BASH	...	0
160	BASH	Thank you, Secretary.	0
161	BASH	Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.	0
162	BASH	You said, quote, "That's their decision."	0
163	BASH	Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?	0
164	SANDERS	First, Dana...	0
165	BASH	when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?	0
166	SANDERS	That's right.	0
167	SANDERS	So, let's start off with the basic premise.	0
168	SANDERS	A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.	0
169	SANDERS	What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.	0
170	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.	0
171	SANDERS	Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.	0
172	BASH	But, Senator...	0
173	SANDERS	The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.	0
174	BASH	But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?	0
175	SANDERS	Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.	0
176	SANDERS	You've got to be a certain size.	0
177	SANDERS	And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.	0
178	SANDERS	I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.	0
179	SANDERS	What we need is to make sure that they are safe.	0
180	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
181	CLINTON	Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.	0
182	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
183	CLINTON	Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.	0
184	CLINTON	Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.	0
185	CLINTON	That has to be the judgement of the regulators.	0
186	CLINTON	But, there's another element to this.	0
187	CLINTON	I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.	0
188	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
189	CLINTON	They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.	0
190	BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
191	CLINTON	And hold them accountable as well.	0
192	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
193	BASH	Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.	0
194	BASH	Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?	0
195	SANDERS	Sure.	0
196	SANDERS	Sure.	0
197	SANDERS	The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.	0
198	SANDERS	That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.	0
199	SANDERS	Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.	0
200	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
201	SANDERS	So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.	0
202	SANDERS	And that's what my legislation does.	0
203	CLINTON	Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.	0
204	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
205	CLINTON	It is important -- it's always important.	0
206	CLINTON	It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.	0
207	CLINTON	I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.	0
208	CLINTON	I called them out on their mortgage behavior.	0
209	CLINTON	I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.	0
210	CLINTON	When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.	0
211	CLINTON	That is the law.	0
212	CLINTON	Now, this is our ninth debate.	0
213	CLINTON	In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.	0
214	CLINTON	You don't just say, we're upset about this.	0
215	CLINTON	I'm upset about it.	0
216	CLINTON	You don't just say, go break them up.	0
217	CLINTON	You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.	0
218	BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
219	CLINTON	So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.	0
220	CLINTON	We've got to include the shadow banking sector.	0
221	BASH	Thank you.	0
222	BASH	Senator Sanders.	0
223	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
224	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton called them out.	0
225	SANDERS	Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.	0
226	SANDERS	And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?	0
227	SANDERS	So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.	0
228	SANDERS	Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.	0
229	SANDERS	These banks, in my view, have too much power.	0
230	SANDERS	They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.	0
231	SANDERS	If elected president, I will break them up.	0
232	SANDERS	We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.	0
233	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
234	BASH	Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.	0
235	BASH	So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?	0
236	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
237	CLINTON	You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.	0
238	CLINTON	When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.	0
239	CLINTON	I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.	0
240	CLINTON	I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.	0
241	CLINTON	Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.	0
242	CLINTON	It was a giant insurance company, AIG.	0
243	CLINTON	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.	0
244	CLINTON	It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.	0
245	CLINTON	I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...	0
246	BASH	Madam Secretary...	0
247	CLINTON	... but the fact is he did.	0
248	CLINTON	And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...	0
249	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
250	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
251	BASH	Senator Sanders, one second, please.	0
252	BASH	Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.	0
253	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
254	BASH	Why not release them?	0
255	CLINTON	I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.	0
256	CLINTON	This is a new one.	0
257	CLINTON	And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.	0
258	CLINTON	I know that.	0
259	CLINTON	But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.	0
260	CLINTON	And I've released 30 years of tax returns.	0
261	CLINTON	And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.	0
262	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
263	BASH	Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.	0
264	CLINTON	Right.	0
265	BASH	And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.	0
266	BASH	It's not about the Republicans...	0
267	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
268	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
269	CLINTON	You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.	0
270	CLINTON	When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.	0
271	CLINTON	Everybody does it, and then we move forward.	0
272	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
273	SANDERS	Well, let me respond.	0
274	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it.	0
275	SANDERS	I will do it.	0
276	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
277	SANDERS	I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents.	0
278	SANDERS	There were no speeches.	0
279	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
280	SANDERS	And second of all, of course we will release our taxes.	0
281	SANDERS	Jane does our taxes.	0
282	SANDERS	We've been a little bit busy lately.	0
283	SANDERS	You'll excuse us.	0
284	SANDERS	But we will...	0
285	BLITZER	Senator...	0
286	SANDERS	We will get them out.	0
287	BLITZER	Senator...	0
288	CLINTON	Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.	0
289	BLITZER	Senator, when are you -- when are you -- you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.	0
290	SANDERS	Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.	0
291	BLITZER	Which one?	0
292	SANDERS	Last year's.	0
293	BLITZER	2014?	0
294	SANDERS	Yes.	0
295	BLITZER	What about 2013, all the other ones?	0
296	SANDERS	You'll get them, yes.	0
297	SANDERS	Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited.	0
298	SANDERS	They are very boring tax returns.	0
299	SANDERS	No big money from speeches, no major investments.	0
300	SANDERS	Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.	1
301	SANDERS	And that's what that will show.	0
302	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
303	BLITZER	So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?	0
304	SANDERS	Yes.	0
305	BLITZER	And what about the earlier ones? What's the problem...	0
306	SANDERS	Yes.	0
307	BLITZER	What's taking so long?	0
308	BLITZER	Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.	0
309	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
310	SANDERS	Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them.	0
311	SANDERS	And she's been out on the campaign trail.	0
312	SANDERS	We will get them out.	0
313	SANDERS	We'll get them out very shortly.	0
314	SANDERS	It's not a big deal.	0
315	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
316	BLITZER	Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States.	0
317	BLITZER	Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses.	0
318	BLITZER	He says you are, quote, "uninformed on this issue" and disconnected from reality.	0
319	BLITZER	Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?	0
320	SANDERS	Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.	0
321	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
322	SANDERS	And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country.	0
323	SANDERS	This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.	0
324	SANDERS	That's his -- that's his compensation.	0
325	SANDERS	This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs.	0
326	SANDERS	He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.	0
327	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
328	BLITZER	All right.	0
329	BLITZER	Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?	0
330	SANDERS	First of all, the word contempt is not right.	0
331	SANDERS	There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.	0
332	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
333	SANDERS	Verizon happens not to be one of them.	0
334	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
335	SANDERS	And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine.	0
336	SANDERS	He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...	0
337	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
338	SANDERS	-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.	0
339	SYSTEM	(BOOS)	0
340	BLITZER	But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.	0
341	BLITZER	So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?	0
342	SANDERS	Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.	0
343	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
344	SANDERS	And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.	0
345	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
346	SANDERS	We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those.	0
347	SANDERS	That has got to change.	0
348	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
349	BLITZER	Secretary...	0
350	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
351	BLITZER	-- Secretary Clinton?	0
352	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
353	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.	0
354	CLINTON	And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.	0
355	CLINTON	I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.	0
356	CLINTON	I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.	0
357	CLINTON	And that's exactly what I will do.	0
358	CLINTON	When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.	0
359	CLINTON	So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.	0
360	CLINTON	And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.	0
361	CLINTON	I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...	0
362	BLITZER	Senator...	0
363	CLINTON	-- in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.	0
364	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
365	CLINTON	Let's do that again in America.	0
366	BLITZER	Senator, how do you...	0
367	SANDERS	I'm going to respond...	0
368	BLITZER	I'll have you respond in a moment.	0
369	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
370	BLITZER	Stand by.	0
371	SANDERS	Well, look...	0
372	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)	0
373	BLITZER	You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.	0
374	BLITZER	You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
375	BLITZER	But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
376	BLITZER	As president...	0
377	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
378	BLITZER	-- if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?	0
379	CLINTON	Well, of course I would.	0
380	CLINTON	And I have supported...	0
381	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
382	CLINTON	-- I have supported the fight for 15.	0
383	CLINTON	I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.	0
384	CLINTON	I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.	0
385	CLINTON	I always have.	0
386	CLINTON	I supported that when I was in the Senate.	0
387	SANDERS	Well, look...	0
388	CLINTON	But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.	0
389	CLINTON	If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15.	0
390	CLINTON	That is exactly my position.	0
391	CLINTON	It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.	0
392	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
393	CLINTON	Go as quickly as...	0
394	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
395	CLINTON	-- to get to $15.	0
396	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
397	SANDERS	I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.	0
398	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
399	CLINTON	You know, wait a minute...	0
400	SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).	0
401	CLINTON	-- wait a minute.	0
402	SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).	0
403	CLINTON	-- wait, wait...	0
404	SANDERS	That's just not accurate.	0
405	SANDERS	Well...	0
406	CLINTON	Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...	0
407	SANDERS	-- well and I...	0
408	CLINTON	-- with Senator Sanders eight...	0
409	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
410	CLINTON	-- times.	0
411	SANDERS	Excuse me.	0
412	CLINTON	I have said the...	0
413	SANDERS	Well...	0
414	CLINTON	Exact same thing.	0
415	BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, please.	0
416	CLINTON	If we can...	0
417	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
418	CLINTON	-- raise it to $15 in New York...	0
419	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
420	CLINTON	-- or Los Angeles or Seattle...	0
421	BLITZER	Secretary, the viewers...	0
422	CLINTON	-- let's do it.	0
423	BLITZER	If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.	0
424	SANDERS	OK.	0
425	BLITZER	So please...	0
426	SANDERS	I will...	0
427	BLITZER	-- don't talk over each other.	0
428	SANDERS	I believe I was...	0
429	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
430	BLITZER	Go ahead.	0
431	SANDERS	-- responding.	0
432	SANDERS	All right?	0
433	SANDERS	When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.	1
434	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.	1
435	SANDERS	There's a difference.	0
436	SANDERS	And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.	0
437	CLINTON	OK.	0
438	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
439	BLITZER	Go ahead, Secretary.	0
440	BLITZER	Secretary?	0
441	SANDERS	And suddenly...	0
442	BLITZER	Secretary, go ahead.	0
443	SANDERS	To suddenly...	0
444	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
445	CLINTON	Thank you very much.	0
446	SANDERS	To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.	0
447	BLITZER	All right.	0
448	BLITZER	Secretary?	0
449	CLINTON	All right.	0
450	CLINTON	I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.	0
451	CLINTON	I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.	0
452	CLINTON	I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.	0
453	CLINTON	I supported in Seattle.	0
454	CLINTON	I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.	0
455	CLINTON	The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right?	0
456	CLINTON	We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that.	0
457	CLINTON	I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.	0
458	CLINTON	Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.	0
459	CLINTON	Thirty-five million people will get a raise.	0
460	CLINTON	One in four working mothers will get a raise.	0
461	CLINTON	I want to get something done.	0
462	CLINTON	And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15.	0
463	CLINTON	But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.	0
464	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
465	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
466	SANDERS	Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.	0
467	SANDERS	I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.	0
468	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
469	SANDERS	Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage.	0
470	SANDERS	That's good.	0
471	SANDERS	I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.	0
472	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
473	SANDERS	And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...	0
474	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
475	SANDERS	I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.	0
476	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
477	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
478	BLITZER	We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America.	0
479	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, "the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."	0
480	BLITZER	But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.	0
481	BLITZER	Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?	0
482	CLINTON	No, of course not.	0
483	CLINTON	Of course not.	0
484	CLINTON	This is -- this is a serious difference between us.	0
485	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
486	CLINTON	And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.	0
487	CLINTON	I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.	0
488	CLINTON	So, yes, we have a problem in America.	0
489	CLINTON	We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.	0
490	CLINTON	We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.	0
491	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
492	CLINTON	And what we have here is a big difference.	0
493	CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.	0
494	CLINTON	He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.	0
495	CLINTON	Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.	0
496	CLINTON	He said they didn't deserve their day in court.	0
497	CLINTON	I could not disagree more.	0
498	CLINTON	And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.	0
499	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
500	CLINTON	That has this kind of special protection.	0
501	CLINTON	We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree.	0
502	CLINTON	We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...	0
503	BLITZER	...	0
504	BLITZER	Thank you...	0
505	CLINTON	... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?	0
506	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
507	BLITZER	Senator?	0
508	BLITZER	Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.	0
509	BLITZER	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.	0
510	BLITZER	You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.	0
511	BLITZER	You made the point what she said was totally absurd.	0
512	BLITZER	I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.	0
513	BLITZER	She said no.	0
514	BLITZER	But, go ahead.	0
515	SANDERS	Then why did she put out that statement?	0
516	CLINTON	I put it out...	0
517	SANDERS	...	0
518	SANDERS	Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.	0
519	BLITZER	Please, go ahead sir.	0
520	SANDERS	A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.	0
521	SANDERS	Here is the fact on guns.	0
522	SANDERS	Let's talk about guns.	0
523	SANDERS	That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.	0
524	SANDERS	Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.	0
525	SANDERS	I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?	0
526	SANDERS	We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.	0
527	SANDERS	I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
528	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
529	SANDERS	And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.	0
530	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
531	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
532	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
533	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
534	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?	0
535	CLINTON	Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.	0
536	CLINTON	They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.	0
537	CLINTON	But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.	0
538	CLINTON	He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.	0
539	CLINTON	And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.	0
540	CLINTON	He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.	0
541	CLINTON	So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.	1
542	CLINTON	Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.	0
543	CLINTON	Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.	0
544	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
545	BLITZER	Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.	0
546	BLITZER	You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.	0
547	BLITZER	The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.	0
548	BLITZER	Do you?	0
549	SANDERS	What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.	0
550	SANDERS	Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.	0
551	SANDERS	But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.	0
552	SANDERS	They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.	0
553	BLITZER	So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?	0
554	SANDERS	No, I don't think I owe them an apology.	0
555	SANDERS	They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.	0
556	SANDERS	They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.	0
557	CLINTON	Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.	1
558	CLINTON	This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.	0
559	CLINTON	And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.	0
560	CLINTON	And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.	0
561	CLINTON	What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.	0
562	CLINTON	New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.	0
563	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
564	CLINTON	The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.	0
565	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
566	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
567	SANDERS	Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.	0
568	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
569	BLITZER	Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.	0
570	LOUIS	Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.	0
571	LOUIS	It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.	0
572	LOUIS	Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?	0
573	CLINTON	Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.	0
574	CLINTON	And you mentioned some of them.	0
575	CLINTON	The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.	0
576	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
577	CLINTON	And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.	0
578	CLINTON	So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.	0
579	CLINTON	On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.	0
580	CLINTON	I think that sentences got much too long.	0
581	CLINTON	The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.	0
582	CLINTON	So we have a problem.	0
583	CLINTON	And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.	0
584	CLINTON	So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.	0
585	CLINTON	So that's how I see it.	0
586	CLINTON	And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.	0
587	LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary.	0
588	CLINTON	To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.	0
589	LOUIS	Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, "I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake."	0
590	LOUIS	Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, "it's clearly insufficient."	0
591	LOUIS	Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?	0
592	CLINTON	Well, look, I supported the crime bill.	0
593	CLINTON	My husband has apologized.	0
594	CLINTON	He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...	0
595	LOUIS	But what about you, Senator?	0
596	CLINTON	... voted for it.	0
597	CLINTON	I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.	0
598	CLINTON	I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.	0
599	CLINTON	That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.	0
600	CLINTON	And I also want people...	0
601	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
602	CLINTON	... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.	0
603	CLINTON	It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.	0
604	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
605	LOUIS	Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.	0
606	LOUIS	Why did you call him out?	0
607	SANDERS	Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.	0
608	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
609	SANDERS	Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.	0
610	SANDERS	We had a crime bill.	0
611	SANDERS	I voted for it.	0
612	SANDERS	It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.	0
613	SANDERS	When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.	0
614	SANDERS	This took us a good step forward.	0
615	SANDERS	We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.	0
616	SANDERS	This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.	0
617	SANDERS	But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.	0
618	SANDERS	We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.	0
619	SANDERS	And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.	0
620	SANDERS	And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.	0
621	SANDERS	The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.	0
622	SANDERS	You know what I think?	0
623	SANDERS	Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.	0
624	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
625	SANDERS	And I'll tell you what else.	0
626	SANDERS	And I'll tell you what else I think.	0
627	SANDERS	And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.	0
628	SANDERS	We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.	0
629	SANDERS	Too many lives...	0
630	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
631	SANDERS	Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.	0
632	SANDERS	And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.	0
633	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
634	LOUIS	Thank you.	0
635	LOUIS	Thank you.	0
636	LOUIS	Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.	0
637	CLINTON	Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.	0
638	CLINTON	I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.	0
639	CLINTON	And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.	0
640	CLINTON	We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.	0
641	CLINTON	That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...	0
642	LOUIS	Thank you.	0
643	LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
644	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
645	CLINTON	... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.	0
646	LOUIS	Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.	0
647	LOUIS	Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.	0
648	LOUIS	So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.	0
649	LOUIS	To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.	0
650	LOUIS	How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?	0
651	SANDERS	We're going to work with state governments all over this country.	0
652	SANDERS	And you know what?	0
653	SANDERS	In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.	0
654	SANDERS	With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.	0
655	SANDERS	On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.	0
656	SANDERS	We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.	0
657	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
658	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
659	BLITZER	We have to take a quick commercial break.	0
660	BLITZER	We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.	0
661	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
662	BLITZER	Welcome back.	0
663	BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue.	0
664	BLITZER	Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.	0
665	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.	0
666	BLITZER	You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.	0
667	BLITZER	What are his lies?	0
668	CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.	0
669	CLINTON	And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.	0
670	CLINTON	But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.	0
671	CLINTON	And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.	0
672	CLINTON	And everyone who's looked at this independently, "The Washington Post" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.	0
673	CLINTON	So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	0
674	CLINTON	Best we can tell from the reports that are done.	0
675	CLINTON	But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	0
676	CLINTON	And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.	0
677	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
678	BLITZER	We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.	0
679	SANDERS	It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.	0
680	SANDERS	I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.	0
681	SANDERS	But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.	0
682	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
683	SANDERS	Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.	0
684	SANDERS	That's true.	0
685	SANDERS	But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.	0
686	SANDERS	Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.	0
687	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
688	SANDERS	And, it is not good enough.	0
689	SANDERS	You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.	0
690	SANDERS	That was what 9/11 was about.	0
691	SANDERS	We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.	0
692	SANDERS	There's going to be international conflict.	0
693	SANDERS	(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...	0
694	BLITZER	... Thank you...	0
695	SANDERS	... Including a tax on carbon.	0
696	SANDERS	Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.	0
697	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
698	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.	0
699	CLINTON	Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.	0
700	CLINTON	Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.	0
701	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
702	CLINTON	I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.	0
703	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
704	CLINTON	And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.	0
705	CLINTON	You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...	0
706	BLITZER	... Thank you...	0
707	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE CHEERING)	0
708	CLINTON	... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...	0
709	BLITZER	... Go ahead, Senator...	0
710	SANDERS	... Let's talk about that.	0
711	SANDERS	When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.	0
712	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
713	SANDERS	The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.	0
714	SANDERS	We've got to get beyond paper right now.	0
715	SANDERS	We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.	0
716	SANDERS	(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.	0
717	SANDERS	Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.	0
718	SANDERS	That's not Secretary Clinton's position.	0
719	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
720	BLITZER	Let us support a tax on carbon...	0
721	BLITZER	... Secretary Clinton...	0
722	SANDERS	... Not Secretary Clinton's position.	0
723	BLITZER	... Go ahead and respond.	0
724	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
725	CLINTON	Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.	0
726	CLINTON	He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.	0
727	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
728	CLINTON	And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.	0
729	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
730	CLINTON	Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.	0
731	CLINTON	It's harder to do something about the problem.	0
732	CLINTON	And...	0
733	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
734	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
735	BLITZER	We'll continue on this.	0
736	BLITZER	Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.	0
737	SANDERS	Wolf.	0
738	SANDERS	Wolf.	0
739	BLITZER	We're going to continue on this.	0
740	BLITZER	Errol, go ahead.	0
741	LOUIS	OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.	0
742	LOUIS	Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.	0
743	LOUIS	Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.	0
744	LOUIS	Why have you changed your view on fracking?	0
745	CLINTON	No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.	0
746	CLINTON	And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.	0
747	CLINTON	So we did say natural gas is a bridge.	0
748	CLINTON	We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.	0
749	CLINTON	That's why I've set big goals.	0
750	CLINTON	I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.	0
751	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
752	CLINTON	So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.	0
753	LOUIS	Thank you, Secretary.	0
754	LOUIS	All right, Senator?	0
755	SANDERS	All right, here is -- here is a real difference.	0
756	SANDERS	This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.	0
757	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
758	SANDERS	Not right now.	0
759	SANDERS	Not on climate change.	0
760	SANDERS	Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.	0
761	SANDERS	Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.	0
762	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
763	SANDERS	And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.	0
764	SANDERS	Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?	0
765	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
766	CLINTON	You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.	0
767	CLINTON	I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.	0
768	CLINTON	I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.	0
769	CLINTON	That's exactly what I have proposed.	0
770	LOUIS	OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
771	CLINTON	And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.	0
772	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
773	LOUIS	Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.	0
774	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.	0
775	LOUIS	Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...	0
776	SANDERS	Are you for a tax on carbon or not?	0
777	LOUIS	I have a question for you.	0
778	LOUIS	You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.	0
779	LOUIS	You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.	0
780	LOUIS	You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.	0
781	LOUIS	But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?	0
782	SANDERS	No, they wouldn't.	0
783	SANDERS	Look, here's where we are.	0
784	SANDERS	Let me reiterate.	0
785	SANDERS	We have a global crisis.	0
786	SANDERS	Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.	0
787	SANDERS	Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.	0
788	SANDERS	It is absolutely true.	0
789	SANDERS	There will be some people who lose their job.	0
790	SANDERS	And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.	0
791	SANDERS	It is not their fault...	0
792	SANDERS	It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.	0
793	SANDERS	But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.	0
794	SANDERS	What does that mean?	0
795	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Senator -- senator, jobs...	0
796	SANDERS	Yes?	0
797	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...	0
798	SANDERS	Well, you don't phase...	0
799	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	-- that difference?	0
800	SANDERS	-- it all out tomorrow.	0
801	SANDERS	And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.	0
802	SANDERS	But this is what you do do.	0
803	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
804	SANDERS	What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.	0
805	SANDERS	We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.	0
806	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
807	SANDERS	Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.	0
808	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
809	SANDERS	Our mass transit system.	0
810	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
811	SANDERS	If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.	0
812	SANDERS	That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.	0
813	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
814	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
815	SANDERS	Lead the world.	0
816	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
817	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
818	BLITZER	Let's turn to another critically important issue...	0
819	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
820	BLITZER	-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.	0
821	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.	0
822	BLITZER	You were his secretary of State.	0
823	BLITZER	Aren't you also responsible for that?	0
824	CLINTON	Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.	0
825	CLINTON	And here's what we did.	0
826	CLINTON	We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.	0
827	CLINTON	I was very proud of that.	0
828	CLINTON	We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.	0
829	CLINTON	We also worked to help them set up their government.	0
830	CLINTON	We sent a lot of American experts there.	0
831	CLINTON	We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.	0
832	CLINTON	They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.	0
833	CLINTON	And so we were caught in a very difficult position.	0
834	CLINTON	They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.	0
835	CLINTON	And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.	0
836	CLINTON	And we can't walk away from that.	0
837	CLINTON	We need to be working with European and Arab partners...	0
838	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
839	CLINTON	-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.	0
840	CLINTON	The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.	0
841	CLINTON	And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them	0
842	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
843	SANDERS	According to "The New York Times.	0
844	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
845	SANDERS	-- for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?	0
846	SANDERS	The New York Times" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change.	0
847	SANDERS	And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.	0
848	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
849	SANDERS	Look...	0
850	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
851	SANDERS	-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.	0
852	SANDERS	No debate about that.	0
853	SANDERS	But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.	0
854	SANDERS	Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.	0
855	SANDERS	And I think if you studied the whole history of...	0
856	BLITZER	Yes.	0
857	SANDERS	-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.	0
858	BLITZER	Secretary, we're going to let you respond.	0
859	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
860	CLINTON	Yes, well, I...	0
861	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
862	CLINTON	-- I...	0
863	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
864	CLINTON	-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.	0
865	CLINTON	Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.	0
866	SANDERS	No.	0
867	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
868	CLINTON	We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.	0
869	CLINTON	We went to the United Nations Security Council.	0
870	CLINTON	We got support from the Security Council.	0
871	CLINTON	And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.	0
872	CLINTON	This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.	0
873	CLINTON	And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.	0
874	CLINTON	Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.	0
875	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
876	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
877	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
878	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.	0
879	SANDERS	What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?	0
880	SANDERS	Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.	0
881	SANDERS	But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.	0
882	SANDERS	Totally different issue.	0
883	CLINTON	Well, that isn't...	0
884	SANDERS	Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...	0
885	BLITZER	Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.	0
886	BLITZER	Go ahead, Secretary.	0
887	CLINTON	There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.	0
888	CLINTON	So, yes, it was unanimous.	0
889	CLINTON	That's exactly right, including you.	0
890	CLINTON	And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.	0
891	CLINTON	The decision was the president's.	0
892	CLINTON	Did I do the due diligence?	0
893	CLINTON	Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?	0
894	CLINTON	Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?	0
895	CLINTON	Yes, I did.	0
896	CLINTON	That's what a secretary of state does.	0
897	CLINTON	But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.	0
898	CLINTON	And the president made that decision.	0
899	CLINTON	And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.	0
900	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
901	BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.	0
902	SANDERS	If you listen, you know -- two points.	0
903	SANDERS	Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.	0
904	SANDERS	But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.	0
905	SANDERS	Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.	0
906	SANDERS	Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.	0
907	CLINTON	Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.	0
908	CLINTON	Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.	0
909	CLINTON	The president said no.	0
910	CLINTON	Now, that's how it works.	0
911	CLINTON	People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.	0
912	CLINTON	So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.	0
913	CLINTON	And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.	0
914	BLITZER	Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.	0
915	BASH	Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: "It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."	0
916	BLITZER	Do you still feel that way?	0
917	SANDERS	Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.	0
918	SANDERS	Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.	0
919	SANDERS	Yes, I do.	0
920	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
921	BASH	And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.	0
922	BASH	So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?	0
923	SANDERS	Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.	0
924	SANDERS	All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.	0
925	SANDERS	So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.	0
926	SANDERS	You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.	0
927	SANDERS	Nothing wrong with that.	0
928	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
929	BASH	Secretary Clinton?	0
930	CLINTON	I support our continuing involvement in NATO.	0
931	CLINTON	And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.	0
932	CLINTON	There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.	0
933	CLINTON	But there's a larger question here.	0
934	CLINTON	NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.	0
935	CLINTON	It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.	0
936	CLINTON	So...	0
937	BASH	But, Madam Secretary...	0
938	CLINTON	... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.	0
939	BASH	That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.	0
940	BASH	If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?	0
941	CLINTON	I will stay in NATO.	0
942	CLINTON	I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.	0
943	CLINTON	Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.	0
944	CLINTON	Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.	0
945	CLINTON	They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.	0
946	CLINTON	That meant a lot.	0
947	CLINTON	And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.	0
948	CLINTON	With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.	0
949	CLINTON	Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.	0
950	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
951	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
952	BLITZER	Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.	0
953	BLITZER	Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, "disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."	0
954	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
955	BLITZER	What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?	0
956	SANDERS	Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.	0
957	SANDERS	That is not a debate.	0
958	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
959	SANDERS	But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.	0
960	SANDERS	Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.	0
961	SANDERS	But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.	0
962	AUDIENCE MEMBER	Free Palestine!	0
963	SANDERS	Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.	0
964	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
965	SANDERS	And, let me say something else.	0
966	SANDERS	As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.	0
967	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
968	SANDERS	So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.	0
969	SANDERS	You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.	0
970	SANDERS	I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.	0
971	SANDERS	That does not make me anti-Israel.	0
972	SANDERS	That paves the way, I think...	0
973	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator...	0
974	SANDERS	...to an approach that works in the Middle East.	0
975	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
976	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
977	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?	0
978	CLINTON	I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.	0
979	CLINTON	I did it in concert with...	0
980	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
981	CLINTON	President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.	0
982	CLINTON	I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.	0
983	CLINTON	They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.	0
984	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
985	CLINTON	They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.	0
986	CLINTON	And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.	0
987	CLINTON	So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.	0
988	CLINTON	You have a right to defend yourself.	0
989	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
990	CLINTON	That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.	0
991	CLINTON	And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.	0
992	CLINTON	It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...	0
993	BLITZER	Thank you...	0
994	CLINTON	... just let me finish.	0
995	CLINTON	The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.	0
996	CLINTON	And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.	0
997	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
998	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.	0
999	SANDERS	I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.	0
1000	SANDERS	That is not the issue.	0
1001	SANDERS	And, you evaded the answer.	0
1002	SANDERS	You evaded the question.	0
1003	SANDERS	The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.	0
1004	SANDERS	That's not the debate.	0
1005	SANDERS	Was their response disproportionate?	0
1006	SANDERS	I believe that it was, you have not answered that.	0
1007	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
1008	CLINTON	I will certainly be willing to answer it.	0
1009	CLINTON	I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.	0
1010	SYSTEM	(AUDIENCE REACTION)	0
1011	CLINTON	I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.	0
1012	CLINTON	It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.	0
1013	CLINTON	They took out all the Israelis.	0
1014	CLINTON	They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.	0
1015	CLINTON	And what happened?	0
1016	CLINTON	Hamas took over Gaza.	0
1017	CLINTON	So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.	0
1018	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1019	BLITZER	Senator.	0
1020	SANDERS	I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.	0
1021	SANDERS	I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.	0
1022	SANDERS	Almost none in that speech.	0
1023	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1024	SANDERS	So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.	0
1025	SANDERS	That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.	0
1026	CLINTON	Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.	0
1027	CLINTON	And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.	0
1028	CLINTON	There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.	0
1029	CLINTON	Three long meetings.	0
1030	CLINTON	And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.	0
1031	CLINTON	I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.	0
1032	CLINTON	And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.	0
1033	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1034	BLITZER	A final word, Senator, go ahead.	0
1035	SANDERS	There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.	0
1036	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1037	CLINTON	Well...	0
1038	BLITZER	Secretary.	0
1039	CLINTON	... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.	0
1040	CLINTON	Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.	0
1041	CLINTON	If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.	0
1042	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
1043	SANDERS	You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.	0
1044	SANDERS	And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.	0
1045	SANDERS	All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.	0
1046	SANDERS	There are two sides to the issue.	0
1047	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1048	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1049	BLITZER	We have to take another quick, quick break.	0
1050	BLITZER	But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.	0
1051	BLITZER	That is coming up right after this.	0
1052	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1053	BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.	0
1054	BLITZER	We're here in Brooklyn.	0
1055	BLITZER	Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.	0
1056	BLITZER	Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.	0
1057	BLITZER	The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.	0
1058	BLITZER	How is this fiscally responsible?	0
1059	SANDERS	Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.	0
1060	SANDERS	There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.	0
1061	SANDERS	For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.	0
1062	SANDERS	My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...	0
1063	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1064	SANDERS	... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.	0
1065	SANDERS	Public colleges and universities tuition free?	0
1066	SANDERS	Damn right.	0
1067	SANDERS	That is exactly what we should be doing.	0
1068	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1069	SANDERS	And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.	0
1070	SANDERS	Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.	0
1071	SANDERS	The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.	0
1072	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1073	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1074	BLITZER	Secretary, go ahead and respond.	0
1075	CLINTON	Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.	0
1076	CLINTON	Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.	0
1077	CLINTON	And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.	0
1078	CLINTON	And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.	0
1079	CLINTON	We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.	0
1080	CLINTON	There's no doubt about that.	0
1081	CLINTON	But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...	0
1082	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1083	CLINTON	... are actually going to work.	0
1084	CLINTON	And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.	0
1085	CLINTON	He changed in the middle of this campaign.	0
1086	CLINTON	He put out another plan.	0
1087	CLINTON	People have been analyzing the new plan.	0
1088	CLINTON	And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.	0
1089	CLINTON	In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.	0
1090	CLINTON	A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.	0
1091	CLINTON	The same for free college.	0
1092	CLINTON	The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.	0
1093	CLINTON	You read the fine print, and here's what it says.	0
1094	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1095	CLINTON	The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...	0
1096	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
1097	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1098	CLINTON	... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.	0
1099	SANDERS	I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.	0
1100	BLITZER	Secretary please.	0
1101	SANDERS	We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.	0
1102	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1103	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.	0
1104	SANDERS	I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?	0
1105	SANDERS	It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.	0
1106	SANDERS	They're doing OK.	0
1107	SANDERS	They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.	0
1108	SANDERS	We can do the same.	0
1109	SANDERS	In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing.	0
1110	SANDERS	Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?	0
1111	SANDERS	For trying to get an education.	0
1112	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1113	SANDERS	So, yes, we are going to pay for it...	0
1114	CLINTON	Well...	0
1115	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead.	0
1116	CLINTON	We have -- we have a difference of opinion.	0
1117	CLINTON	We both want to get to universal health care coverage.	0
1118	CLINTON	I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
1119	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1120	CLINTON	And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.	0
1121	CLINTON	So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...	0
1122	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1123	CLINTON	... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.	0
1124	BLITZER	Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue.	0
1125	BLITZER	Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.	0
1126	BLITZER	Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?	0
1127	BLITZER	Yes or no, would you lift the cap?	0
1128	CLINTON	I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
1129	CLINTON	That is one way.	0
1130	CLINTON	If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.	0
1131	CLINTON	But there are other ways.	0
1132	CLINTON	We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.	0
1133	CLINTON	We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.	0
1134	CLINTON	But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.	0
1135	CLINTON	I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.	0
1136	CLINTON	I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.	0
1137	CLINTON	But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.	0
1138	CLINTON	And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.	0
1139	CLINTON	And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...	0
1140	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
1141	CLINTON	-- system and that will be my highest priority.	0
1142	BLITZER	Senator?	0
1143	BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.	0
1144	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1145	SANDERS	An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.	0
1146	CLINTON	I did.	0
1147	CLINTON	If that's the way we're...	0
1148	SANDERS	No, you didn't.	0
1149	SANDERS	My legi...	0
1150	CLINTON	-- yes, I did.	0
1151	SANDERS	Can I answer...	0
1152	CLINTON	I did answer the...	0
1153	SANDERS	-- may I please...	0
1154	CLINTON	Well, don't -- don't put words...	0
1155	SANDERS	-- can I have... (CROSSTALK)	0
1156	CLINTON	-- into my mouth and say something...	0
1157	SANDERS	-- do I not?	0
1158	CLINTON	-- that's not accurate.	0
1159	BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.	0
1160	SANDERS	All right.	0
1161	SANDERS	Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...	0
1162	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1163	SANDERS	Now, we've got -- here is the issue.	0
1164	SANDERS	Your answer has been the same year after year.	0
1165	SANDERS	In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea.	0
1166	SANDERS	It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea.	0
1167	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1168	SANDERS	He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up.	0
1169	SANDERS	If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.	0
1170	SANDERS	You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.	0
1171	SANDERS	What's wrong with that?	0
1172	SANDERS	Are you prepared to support it?	0
1173	CLINTON	I have supported it.	0
1174	CLINTON	You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.	0
1175	SANDERS	You have sup...	0
1176	CLINTON	I think it's important...	0
1177	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1178	CLINTON	-- to point out that...	0
1179	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1180	CLINTON	-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
1181	CLINTON	Think about what the other side wants to do.	0
1182	CLINTON	They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.	0
1183	CLINTON	They still want to privatize it.	1
1184	CLINTON	In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.	1
1185	SANDERS	All right, so...	0
1186	CLINTON	So, yes, we both want to make sure...	0
1187	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1188	SANDERS	Look, Wolf...	0
1189	CLINTON	-- Social Security (INAUDIBLE)...	0
1190	SANDERS	-- I am very glad that...	0
1191	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0

1213	LOUIS	Secretary...	0
1214	CLINTON	I -- as he said, I've said the same thing for years.	0
1215	CLINTON	I didn't say anything different tonight.	0
1216	CLINTON	We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
1217	CLINTON	There is still something called Congress.	0
1218	CLINTON	Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...	0
1219	BLITZER	Errol...	0
1220	CLINTON	-- so a lot of -- a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...	0
1221	BLITZER	Errol, hold on a second.	0
1222	CLINTON	-- when I am president.	0
1223	LOUIS	Secretary...	0
1224	BLITZER	Go ahead.	0

1228	BLITZER	Hold on.	0
1229	SANDERS	I've got to admit...	0
1230	BLITZER	Go ahead, Senator.	0
1231	SANDERS	-- maybe I'm a little bit confused.	0
1232	SANDERS	Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...	0
1233	CLINTON	I am...	0
1234	SANDERS	-- yes or no?	0
1235	CLINTON	I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination...	0
1236	SANDERS	Oh, you -- ah.	0
1237	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1238	SYSTEM	(BOOS)	0
1239	SANDERS	OK.	0
1240	CLINTON	-- or combination of ways...	0
1241	SYSTEM	(BOOS)	0
1242	CLINTON	-- you know...	0
1243	SYSTEM	(BOOS)	0
1244	CLINTON	-- it -- it's all -- it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.	0
1245	CLINTON	Well, let me say then...	0
1246	SANDERS	Well, look...	0
1247	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1248	CLINTON	-- let me say this...	0
1249	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1250	CLINTON	-- we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
1251	CLINTON	We've got some good ideas to do it.	0
1252	CLINTON	Let's get a Congress elected...	0
1253	BLITZER	Thank you.	0
1254	CLINTON	-- that will actually agree...	0
1255	BLITZER	Well, thank you...	0
1256	CLINTON	-- with us in doing it.	0
1257	BLITZER	Errol, go ahead.	0
1258	LOUIS	OK, Secretary Clinton, I've got a question for you from a reader...	0
1259	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1260	SANDERS	Let me interject here.	0
1261	LOUIS	-- of the "New York Daily News."	0
1262	SANDERS	Yes, Secretary Clinton...	0
1263	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1264	SANDERS	-- you are a member of the establishment.	0
1265	LOUIS	-- this was a reader...	0
1266	SANDERS	(INAUDIBLE).	0
1267	LOUIS	-- of "The Daily News" who sent us a...	0
1268	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
1269	LOUIS	-- a question for you.	0
1270	LOUIS	Just a second, Senator.	0
1271	LOUIS	Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court.	0
1272	LOUIS	President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election.	0
1273	LOUIS	If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?	0
1274	CLINTON	I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this.	0
1275	CLINTON	And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals.	0
1276	CLINTON	I fully support the president.	0
1277	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1278	CLINTON	And I believe that the president -- the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history.	0
1279	CLINTON	And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond.	0
1280	CLINTON	So I'm going to support the president.	0
1281	CLINTON	When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.	0
1282	LOUIS	Senator Sanders.	0
1283	SANDERS	Well, there is no question.	0
1284	SANDERS	I mean, it really is an outrage.	0
1285	SANDERS	And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.	0
1286	SANDERS	I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court.	0
1287	SANDERS	Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.	0
1288	LOUIS	So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?	0
1289	SANDERS	Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate.	0
1290	SANDERS	But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this.	0
1291	SANDERS	I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.	0
1292	CLINTON	You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.	0
1293	CLINTON	And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.	0
1294	CLINTON	We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.	0
1295	CLINTON	We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.	1
1296	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1297	CLINTON	And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights.	0
1298	CLINTON	We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.	0
1299	CLINTON	And we are never asked about this.	0
1300	CLINTON	And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.	0
1301	CLINTON	I don't think it's a distraction.	0
1302	CLINTON	It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.	0
1303	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response.	0
1304	SANDERS	You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so.	0
1305	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1306	BASH	Thank you, Senator.	0
1307	SANDERS	Who not only thinks we are not going to -- not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.	0
1308	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1309	BASH	Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress.	0
1310	BASH	You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.	0
1311	BASH	Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat.	0
1312	BASH	Are you?	0
1313	SANDERS	Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?	0
1314	SANDERS	But here is a good point.	0
1315	SANDERS	You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.	0
1316	SANDERS	I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.	0
1317	SANDERS	And you know why?	0
1318	SANDERS	Because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.	0
1319	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1320	BASH	Senator Sanders...	0
1321	SANDERS	And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes.	0
1322	SANDERS	We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.	0
1323	BASH	Senator Sanders.	0
1324	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1325	SANDERS	I am in this race as a Democrat.	0
1326	SANDERS	I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected.	0
1327	SANDERS	I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.	0
1328	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
1329	BASH	On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times.	0
1330	BASH	She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year.	0
1331	BASH	You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.	0
1332	BASH	Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.	0
1333	BASH	Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?	0
1334	SANDERS	The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC.	0
1335	SANDERS	I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.	0
1336	SANDERS	But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.	0
1337	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1338	SANDERS	And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors.	0
1339	SANDERS	I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...	0
1340	BASH	...	0
1341	BASH	Thank you Senator.	0
1342	SANDERS	$27 a contribution...	0
1343	BASH	...	0
1344	BASH	Senator, your time is up...	0
1345	BASH	SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.	0
1346	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
1347	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1348	BASH	Secretary Clinton.	0
1349	CLINTON	Let us talk about where we are in this race.	0
1350	CLINTON	I've gotten more votes than anybody running.	0
1351	CLINTON	9.6 million at the last count.	0
1352	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
1353	CLINTON	That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.	0
1354	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1355	CLINTON	And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.	0
1356	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
1357	CLINTON	I think you have to look at the facts.	0
1358	CLINTON	And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.	0
1359	CLINTON	It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.	0
1360	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
1361	BASH	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
1362	BASH	Senator Sanders.	0
1363	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
1364	CLINTON	And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.	0
1365	CLINTON	I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.	0
1366	CLINTON	We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.	0
1367	CLINTON	But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...	0
1368	BASH	... Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
1369	CLINTON	And, I know something about that...	0
1370	BASH	... Secretary Clinton...	0
1371	CLINTON	Thank you so much.	0
1372	CLINTON	Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...	0
1373	BASH	...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time...	0
1374	CLINTON	... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...	0
1375	BASH	...Senator Sanders, on that note....	0
1376	SANDERS	... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...	0
1377	BASH	...	0
1378	BASH	Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response.	0
1379	BASH	Three months now between now and the Democratic convention.	0
1380	BASH	Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.	0
1381	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1382	BASH	Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?	0
1383	SANDERS	I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.	0
1384	SYSTEM	(CHEERING)	0
1385	SANDERS	Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true.	0
1386	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.	0
1387	SANDERS	No question about it.	0
1388	SANDERS	We got murdered there.	0
1389	SANDERS	That is the most conservative part of this great country.	0
1390	SANDERS	That's the fact.	0
1391	SANDERS	But you know what?	0
1392	SANDERS	We're out of the Deep South now.	0
1393	SANDERS	And we're moving up.	0
1394	SANDERS	We got here.	0
1395	SANDERS	We're going to California.	0
1396	SANDERS	We got a number of large states there.	0
1397	SANDERS	And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.	0
1398	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1399	CLINTON	Now, let me say this...	0
1400	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton, go ahead.	0
1401	CLINTON	I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.	0
1402	CLINTON	And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.	0
1403	CLINTON	And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.	0
1404	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1405	CLINTON	And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.	0
1406	CLINTON	I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.	0
1407	CLINTON	So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.	0
1408	CLINTON	I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.	0
1409	CLINTON	And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...	0
1410	BLITZER	Senator, go ahead.	0
1411	CLINTON	... that we'll go onto the general election with.	0
1412	SANDERS	The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.	0
1413	SANDERS	You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.	0
1414	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1415	SANDERS	And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests.	0
1416	SANDERS	So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...	0
1417	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1418	SANDERS	... many of whom previously had given up.	0
1419	BLITZER	Thank you, Senator, very much.	0
1420	BLITZER	The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this.	0
1421	BLITZER	Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.	0
1422	BLITZER	It's time for the candidates' closing statements.	0
1423	BLITZER	Each candidate will have two minutes.	0
1424	BLITZER	Senator Sanders, you're first.	0
1425	SANDERS	I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...	0
1426	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1427	SANDERS	... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.	0
1428	SANDERS	I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.	0
1429	SANDERS	And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country.	0
1430	SANDERS	I just don't accept that.	0
1431	SANDERS	What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.	0
1432	SANDERS	And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
1433	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1434	SANDERS	That is what the political revolution is about.	0
1435	SANDERS	That is what this campaign is about.	0
1436	SANDERS	And with your help, we're going to win here in New York.	0
1437	SANDERS	Thank you.	0
1438	SANDERS	Thank you.	0
1439	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1440	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?	0
1441	BLITZER	Secretary Clinton?	0
1442	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
1443	CLINTON	I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.	0
1444	CLINTON	You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006.	0
1445	CLINTON	During those years, we worked closely together.	0
1446	CLINTON	I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.	0
1447	CLINTON	We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.	0
1448	CLINTON	We got the money to rebuild New York.	0
1449	CLINTON	We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.	0
1450	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1451	CLINTON	We worked to create jobs -- despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush -- across New York.	0
1452	CLINTON	And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.	0
1453	CLINTON	I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.	0
1454	CLINTON	You know, of course we have economic barriers.	0
1455	CLINTON	I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.	0
1456	CLINTON	But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.	0
1457	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1458	CLINTON	We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.	0
1459	CLINTON	So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.	0
1460	CLINTON	I'll work my heart out for you again.	0
1461	CLINTON	And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep.	0
1462	CLINTON	We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.	0
1463	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1464	CLINTON	That's what we'll do together.	0
1465	CLINTON	Thank you, New York.	0
1466	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1467	BLITZER	Thank you, Secretary.	0
