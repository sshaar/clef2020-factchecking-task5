163	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt.	0

345	Donald Trump	And they can't get approved because every single one of them is being slow-walked by the Democrats, and it's never happened before.	1
346	Donald Trump	And you know what?	0
347	Donald Trump	I hope we have long memories, but I hope we don't have to worry about it because we're going to be there a long time.	0
348	Donald Trump	So we won't have to worry about that.	0
349	Donald Trump	But what they're doing is disgraceful.	0
350	Donald Trump	What they are doing, Schumer and the group, what they are doing is disgraceful.	0
351	Donald Trump	What they're doing to the wall and immigration is disgraceful.	0
352	Donald Trump	And you just take a look at the border, OK?	0
353	Donald Trump	You take a look.	0
354	Donald Trump	Take a look at what's happening.	0
355	Donald Trump	My administration and conservatives in Congress were elected to uphold your rights.	0
356	Donald Trump	To rebuild our military, which we are doing a great job of rebuilding.	0
357	Donald Trump	To restore our prosperity, to secure our communities and defend our borders.	0
358	Donald Trump	We have the worst immigration laws anywhere in the world.	0
359	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.	0
360	Donald Trump	It's not easy for people to come in.	0
361	Donald Trump	I will tell you, it's not-we have the worst laws.	0
362	Donald Trump	After years of defending the borders of other countries-we go into wars with other countries.	0
363	Donald Trump	We shouldn't be there.	0
364	Donald Trump	We go into wars to defend their borders, we don't defend our own borders.	0
365	Donald Trump	And we're going to start defending our country.	0
366	Donald Trump	We're going to start defending our borders.	0
367	Donald Trump	You've all seen, on television, all over the papers.	0
368	Donald Trump	The illegal migrants, pouring up through Mexico, flooding the border.	0
369	Donald Trump	Many from Central America: Honduras, all over the place.	0
370	Donald Trump	Coming up by the thousands.	0
371	Donald Trump	We're stopping them at different fronts.	0
372	Donald Trump	But we don't have laws.	0
373	Donald Trump	We have laws that were written by people that truly could not love our country.	0
374	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration must end.	0
375	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration must end.	0
376	Donald Trump	We are going to have strong borders.	0
377	Donald Trump	I will tell you, we have maxed out every law.	0
378	Donald Trump	We are going to have truly strong-and we're going to take people into our country, but they're going to come in based on merit, not based on picking somebody out of a bin.	1
379	Donald Trump	We are not going to let our country be overwhelmed, and we're going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming C.R.	0
380	Donald Trump	It's going to be very soon, going to be very soon.	0
381	Donald Trump	In recent months, Democratic lawmakers have voted against legislation to close deadly immigration loopholes, like catch-and-release.	1
382	Donald Trump	How about that one?	0
383	Donald Trump	We caught him.	0
384	Donald Trump	Oh.	0
385	Donald Trump	Release him.	0
386	Donald Trump	Bye-bye.	0
387	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
388	Donald Trump	Welcome to America.	0
389	Donald Trump	Welcome to America.	0
390	Donald Trump	That's what we have.	0
391	Donald Trump	We're going to keep the violent criminals out.	0
392	Donald Trump	Sentae Democrats like Jon Tester-you saw what happened there.	0
393	Donald Trump	What he did to one of the finest people in our country.	0
394	Donald Trump	What he did to the admiral-what he did is a disgrace.	0
395	Donald Trump	Jon Tester.	0
396	Donald Trump	Bill Nelson and Bob Casey voted against Kate's Law, legislation named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal immigrant, and you saw what happened with that court case.	0
397	Donald Trump	Can you believe the result of that court case?	0
398	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?	0
399	Donald Trump	The same senators, along with nearly every other Democrat, also voted to protect something that's actually becoming very unpopular, sanctuary cities.	0
400	Donald Trump	Can you believe, finally, people are starting to get it.	0
401	SYSTEM	(BOOING)	0
402	Donald Trump	Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they're releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets.	0
403	Donald Trump	These countries send up their worst.	0
404	Donald Trump	Remember when my opening speech-I got criticized for it, remember?	0
405	Donald Trump	Well, guess what.	0
406	Donald Trump	They're not sending their finest, that I can tell you.	0
407	Donald Trump	We're getting some real beauties in here.	0
408	Donald Trump	But we're taking MS-13, horrible killer gang members, we're getting them out, because our guys are much tougher than theirs.	1
409	Donald Trump	There is not even a little bit of a contest.	0
410	Donald Trump	And that's the only language they understand.	0
411	Donald Trump	That's the only language they understand.	0
412	Donald Trump	These are savage killers.	0
413	Donald Trump	My administration believes our cities should be safe havens for Americans, not sanctuaries for criminals.	0
414	Donald Trump	And we believe that violent gang members must be thrown out of our country immediately, not let to stay, to fester, and to get larger.	0
415	Donald Trump	We get 'em out, and we are kicking 'em out by thousands.	0
416	Donald Trump	If we had the right laws-which we can have very quickly with cooperation-we wouldn't even have a problem.	0
417	Donald Trump	It would be so much better, so much easier.	0
418	Donald Trump	We believe that politicians who put criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office immediately.	0
419	Donald Trump	As we secure our borders, we're also supporting the heroes who fight crime, serve our citizens, and secure our streets, our brave men and brave women in blue.	0
420	Donald Trump	We love them.	0
421	Donald Trump	In my administration, we have a simple policy.	0
422	Donald Trump	We will protect those who protect us.	0
423	Donald Trump	You saw what I did with the military equipment, the excess equipment that was sitting all over the country in warehouses, never to be used again.	0
424	Donald Trump	And other administrations, they just didn't want to give it to the police.	0
425	Donald Trump	They said it's too much protection, it looks too strong, it looks like military.	0
426	Donald Trump	Guess what?	0
427	Donald Trump	It's now being distributed all over to our police forces.	0
428	Donald Trump	And it's better than they could ever buy.	0
429	Donald Trump	You can't buy stuff like that.	0
430	Donald Trump	Today, our love and prayers go out to the family of slain Dallas police officer Rogelio Santander, who last week was murdered in the line of duty very, very close to this arena.	0
431	Donald Trump	We ask God to help the others who were wounded, and they will recover.	0
432	Donald Trump	They will be better.	0
433	Donald Trump	They will be back.	0
434	Donald Trump	Send our love.	0
435	Donald Trump	So important.	0
436	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
437	Donald Trump	And we mourn together with the entire Dallas Police Department.	0
438	Donald Trump	It's a great police department, a police force that has lost too many heroes, but has never lost its will to protect, and to serve you.	0
439	Donald Trump	We're also taking very strong action to secure and protect our most valuable resource: our children.	0
440	Donald Trump	All of us here today are deeply committed to school safety.	0
441	Donald Trump	Nothing is more important than protecting innocent lives.	0
442	Donald Trump	And I will tell you, Wayne and Chris, and all of the people at the NRA, we speak about it all the time.	0
443	Donald Trump	These are great people.	0
444	Donald Trump	These are great Americans.	0
445	Donald Trump	These people have great heart.	0
446	Donald Trump	They know what they're doing.	0
447	Donald Trump	Our entire nation was filled with shock and grief by the monstrous attack on a high school in Parkland, Florida.	0
448	Donald Trump	We mourn for the victims and their families.	0
449	Donald Trump	Gotten to know members of those families.	0
450	Donald Trump	These are incredible people, and our hearts break for every American who has suffered the horrors of these school shootings.	0
451	Donald Trump	In the aftermath of the terrible attack, I met with the survivors, the parents of school shooting victims at the White House.	0
452	Donald Trump	I was inspired, like all of you were, by their incredible courage.	0
453	Donald Trump	We agreed that it's not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we're making a difference.	0
454	Donald Trump	We must ensure that we actually make a difference, and my administration has pursued an aggressive strategy on community safety.	0
455	Donald Trump	We're working to improve early warning systems so that when the police are called, when the community sees the red flags-which they saw in Parkland all over the place.	0
456	Donald Trump	There has never been a case where more red flags have been shown-swift action is taken by the authorities.	0
457	Donald Trump	Law-abiding gun owners want to keep firearms out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves and to others.	0
458	Donald Trump	We all want that.	0
459	Donald Trump	We all want that.	0
460	Donald Trump	I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security, and mental health.	0
461	Donald Trump	Mental health is a big one.	0
462	Donald Trump	They don't like to talk about mental health.	0
463	Donald Trump	Mental health-that was the number one example in Parkland.	0
464	Donald Trump	That legislation also made vital improvements to our background check system, which everybody wants.	0
465	Donald Trump	Finally, all of us agree that we must harden certain schools.	0
466	Donald Trump	At the same time, the police have to be able to get into those schools if there's a problem.	0
467	Donald Trump	We want armed guards.	0
468	Donald Trump	We want to be able to get in.	0
469	Donald Trump	I saw some of the craziest plans that I've ever seen.	0
470	Donald Trump	You can spend a fortune on each school.	0
471	Donald Trump	You will spend so much-nobody knows more about construction than I do.	0
472	Donald Trump	You will spend so much, you're going to make it so hard that you can't run a D8 -- you know what that is, right?	0
473	Donald Trump	-- through the doors.	0
474	Donald Trump	It means a tractor.	0
475	Donald Trump	There's only one problem: If one of these maniacs get in, and it's so hard, you can't get in.	0
476	Donald Trump	So you have to be careful.	0
477	Donald Trump	We strongly believe in allowing highly trained teachers to carry concealed weapons if they're highly trained.	0
478	Donald Trump	And we want highly trained security guards.	0
479	Donald Trump	Ninety-eight percent of mass public shootings have occurred in places where guns are banned, just so you understand.	0
480	Donald Trump	Tragically, as we've seen, there's no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares, This school is a gun-free zone.	0
481	Donald Trump	Come in and take us.	0
482	Donald Trump	Ninety-eight percent.	0
483	Donald Trump	You know, they're cowards.	0
484	Donald Trump	You saw that in the recent case, where he did all of his damage and then he sort of slinked out of the school.	0
485	Donald Trump	And the policeman outside caught him in a different community.	0
486	Donald Trump	That policeman did a good job.	0
487	Donald Trump	That policeman did a good job.	0
488	Donald Trump	Caught him in a different community.	0
489	Donald Trump	But they are cowards.	0
490	Donald Trump	When they know there's guns inside, they're not going in.	0
491	Donald Trump	We just don't understand that.	0
492	Donald Trump	We can't get that word out.	0
493	Donald Trump	But highly trained people.	0
494	Donald Trump	At the same time, there is no stronger deterrent for a sick individual than the knowledge that their attack will end their life and will end in total failure.	0
495	Donald Trump	When they know that, they're not going in.	0
496	Donald Trump	You're not going to have school attacks.	0
497	Donald Trump	We support the Second Amendment.	0
498	Donald Trump	Not only because we believe in freedom, but also because we trust in everyday, talented, wonderful people.	0
499	Donald Trump	They love our students.	0
500	Donald Trump	And by the way, these teachers, they love their students.	0
501	Donald Trump	They love their students.	0
502	Donald Trump	They understand and they love their students, and they're not going to let anybody hurt their students.	0
503	Donald Trump	But you have to give them a chance.	0
504	Donald Trump	In America, we trust the people to be wise and to be good.	0
505	Donald Trump	We trust them to take responsibility for themselves, their families and their communities.	0
506	Donald Trump	And that is why, in America, we have always trusted the people to keep and bear arms.	0
507	Donald Trump	It is fitting that we gather today in the great state of Texas, a place that cherishes their right like no other.	0
508	Donald Trump	You know, before I left today, a couple of people came up to me.	0
509	Donald Trump	Good political people.	0
510	Donald Trump	They said, You know, going to the NRA convention and speaking today, that'll be very controversial.	0
511	Donald Trump	It might not be popular.	0
512	Donald Trump	You know what I said?	0
513	Donald Trump	Bye-bye, got to get on the plane.	0
514	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
515	Donald Trump	Because we have to do the right thing.	0
516	Donald Trump	We have to do the right thing.	0
517	Donald Trump	This proud state would not exist if not for a handful of determined and defiant Texans who refused to surrender their rights nearly two centuries ago.	0
518	Donald Trump	Right?	0
519	Donald Trump	You know who I'm talking about.	0
520	Donald Trump	You know who I'm talking about.	0
521	Donald Trump	In 1835, soldiers from General Santa Ana's army marched into the little Texas town of Gonzales, and ordered those settlers to surrender their small canon they relied on to protect their lives, and protect their homes.	0
522	Donald Trump	The Texans refused.	0
523	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]	0
524	Donald Trump	That's right.	0
525	Donald Trump	They were not about to give up their only means of self defense.	0
526	Donald Trump	In response, Santa Ana's army returned with a large group of additional people.	0
527	Donald Trump	They had men all over the place.	0
528	Donald Trump	The army was big.	0
529	Donald Trump	This time, they were met by dozens of Texans, settlers, soldiers and ordinary citizens who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom.	0
530	Donald Trump	As Santa Ana's men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see, and you know what it said.	0
531	Donald Trump	On the banner, they painted a canon, along with four words that echoed through the ages, and you know what it is.	0
532	Donald Trump	It said, Come and take it.	0
533	Donald Trump	Come and take it.	0
534	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]	0
535	Donald Trump	Like those early Texans, Americans will never surrender, ever, ever, ever.	0
536	Donald Trump	We will never, never surrender.	0
537	Donald Trump	We will never give up our freedom.	0
538	Donald Trump	Americans are born free.	0
539	Donald Trump	We will live free, and we will die free.	0
540	Donald Trump	So again, it is a great honor to be with you, very special people.	0
541	Donald Trump	We truly appreciate your support.	0
542	Donald Trump	I'm going the right thing.	0
543	Donald Trump	I'm doing it for you, but we're doing the right thing.	0
544	Donald Trump	We're doing the right thing together.	0
545	Donald Trump	I want to thank again all of our friends and patriots from the NRA.	0
546	Donald Trump	We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment.	0
547	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
548	Donald Trump	God bless you, and God bless America.	0
549	Donald Trump	Thank you all.	0
550	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
