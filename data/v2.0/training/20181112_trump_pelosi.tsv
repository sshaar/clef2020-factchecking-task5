1	TRUMP	Okay, thank you very much.	0
2	TRUMP	It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.	0
3	TRUMP	And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.	0
4	TRUMP	Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.	0
5	TRUMP	We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.	0
6	TRUMP	So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?	0
7	TRUMP	Many years.	0
8	PELOSI	A long time.	0
9	TRUMP	Many, many years.	0
10	TRUMP	Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way.	0
11	TRUMP	And it's really something we're all very proud of.	0
12	TRUMP	And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.	0
13	TRUMP	And I think it's going to get a very good vote.	0
14	TRUMP	And we'll see soon enough.	0
15	TRUMP	But it will be up for a vote very shortly.	0
16	TRUMP	A lot of years they've been waiting for it.	0
17	TRUMP	The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.	0
18	TRUMP	And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.	0
19	TRUMP	But pretty close.	0
20	SCHUMER	Soon.	0
21	SCHUMER	Soon.	0
22	SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)	0
23	TRUMP	And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.	0
24	TRUMP	A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.	0
25	TRUMP	And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.	0
26	TRUMP	And then we have the easy one, the wall.	0
27	TRUMP	That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.	0
28	TRUMP	What do you think, Chuck?	0
29	TRUMP	Maybe not?	0
30	SCHUMER	It's called "funding the government," Mr. President.	0
31	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
32	TRUMP	So we're going to see.	0
33	TRUMP	But I will tell you, the wall will get built.	0
34	TRUMP	We'll see what happens.	0
35	TRUMP	It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans.	0
36	TRUMP	We have great Republican support.	0
37	TRUMP	We don't have Democrat support.	0
38	TRUMP	But we're going to talk about that now.	0
39	TRUMP	We're going to see.	0
40	TRUMP	One thing that I do have to say is:	0
41	TRUMP	Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall.	0
42	TRUMP	When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.	0
43	TRUMP	In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.	0
44	TRUMP	And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.	0
45	TRUMP	So, a lot of wall has been built.	0
46	TRUMP	We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall.	0
47	TRUMP	And we will continue that.	0
48	TRUMP	And one way or the other, it's going to get built.	0
49	TRUMP	I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.	0
50	TRUMP	We will see what happens over the next short period of time.	0
51	TRUMP	But the wall is a very important thing to us.	0
52	TRUMP	I might put it a different way.	0
53	TRUMP	Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.	0
54	TRUMP	When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice.	0
55	TRUMP	We shut it down.	0
56	TRUMP	But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.	0
57	TRUMP	I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.	0
58	TRUMP	They've been incredible.	0
59	TRUMP	The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.	0
60	TRUMP	And very importantly, our military.	0
61	TRUMP	Our military went in and they did an incredible job.	0
62	TRUMP	They have been really, really spectacular.	0
63	TRUMP	A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.	0
64	TRUMP	They're leaving.	0
65	TRUMP	If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.	0
66	TRUMP	And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.	0
67	TRUMP	So we appreciate that.	0
68	TRUMP	But they haven't been coming into our country.	0
69	TRUMP	We can't let people come in that way.	0
70	TRUMP	So that's pretty much it.	0
71	TRUMP	We're going to talk about the wall.	0
72	TRUMP	I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.	0
73	TRUMP	I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.	0
74	TRUMP	And I want to talk about the wall.	0
75	TRUMP	And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say "border security," but certainly the wall.	0
76	TRUMP	But the wall will get built.	0
77	TRUMP	A lot of the wall is built.	0
78	TRUMP	It's been very effective.	0
79	TRUMP	I asked for a couple of notes on that.	0
80	TRUMP	If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.	0
81	TRUMP	El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.	0
82	TRUMP	In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.	0
83	TRUMP	Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.	0
84	TRUMP	I mean — and when I say "dropped," the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built.	0
85	TRUMP	It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.	0
86	TRUMP	So, I mean, it's very effective.	0
87	TRUMP	If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective.	0
88	TRUMP	And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.	0
89	TRUMP	So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.	0
90	TRUMP	A lot of people don't know that.	0
91	TRUMP	A lot of wall is renovated.	0
92	TRUMP	We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.	0
93	TRUMP	And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.	0
94	TRUMP	Our military has done a fantastic job.	0
95	TRUMP	So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today.	0
96	TRUMP	We probably won't.	0
97	TRUMP	But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.	0
98	TRUMP	Nancy, would you like to say something?	0
99	PELOSI	Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.	0
100	PELOSI	I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.	0
101	PELOSI	You have the White House —	0
102	TRUMP	Did you say "Trump" — oh, oh.	0
103	PELOSI	A "Trump shutdown."	0
104	PELOSI	You have the White House —	0
105	TRUMP	I was going to call it a "Pelosi shutdown."	0
106	PELOSI	You have the Senate.	0
107	PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.	0
108	PELOSI	You have the votes.	0
109	PELOSI	You should pass it right now.	0
110	TRUMP	No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.	0
111	PELOSI	No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.	0
112	TRUMP	Yeah, but I can't — excuse me.	0
113	TRUMP	But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.	0
114	TRUMP	I don't want to waste time.	0
115	PELOSI	Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.	0
116	TRUMP	The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.	0
117	PELOSI	Okay, then do it.	0
118	PELOSI	Then do it.	0
119	TRUMP	But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.	0
120	PELOSI	No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.	0
121	PELOSI	The point is —	0
122	TRUMP	It's sort of the point.	0
123	PELOSI	— that there are equities to be weighed.	0
124	PELOSI	And we are here to have a conversation —	0
125	TRUMP	Correct.	0
126	PELOSI	— in a careful way.	0
127	PELOSI	So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.	0
128	PELOSI	But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.	0
129	TRUMP	If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.	0
130	TRUMP	We would get it passed very easily in the House.	0
131	PELOSI	No, that's not the point.	0
132	PELOSI	That's not the point.	0
133	TRUMP	Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.	0
134	TRUMP	It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.	0
135	TRUMP	That's the problem.	0
136	PELOSI	Well, again, let us have our conversation —	0
137	TRUMP	That's right.	0
138	PELOSI	— and then we can meet with the press again.	0
139	PELOSI	But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —	0
140	TRUMP	Right.	0
141	PELOSI	— you begin, you make your point, you state your case.	0
142	PELOSI	That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.	0
143	PELOSI	But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start.	0
144	SCHUMER	That is exactly right.	0
145	SCHUMER	You don't have the votes in the House.	0
146	TRUMP	If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done.	0
147	PELOSI	Well, then go do it.	0
148	PELOSI	Go do it.	0
149	TRUMP	It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.	0
150	PELOSI	No, don't put it on the Senate.	0
151	PELOSI	Put it on the negotiation.	0
152	TRUMP	Okay, let me ask you this.	0
153	TRUMP	Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.	0
154	TRUMP	It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —	0
155	PELOSI	You will not win.	0
156	TRUMP	It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.	0
157	PELOSI	Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.	0
158	TRUMP	I need 10 senators.	0
159	TRUMP	That's the problem.	0
160	PELOSI	Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.	0
161	TRUMP	I have the White House.	0
162	PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.	0
163	TRUMP	The White House is done.	0
164	TRUMP	And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.	0
165	TRUMP	But I can't because I need —	0
166	PELOSI	But you can't — you can't —	0
167	TRUMP	Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.	0
168	SCHUMER	All right, let me say something here.	0
169	PELOSI	Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing.	0
170	PELOSI	The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.	0
171	TRUMP	Nancy, I do.	0
172	TRUMP	And we need border security.	0
173	PELOSI	Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.	0
174	TRUMP	Nancy.	0
175	TRUMP	Nancy.	0
176	TRUMP	We need border security.	0
177	TRUMP	It's very simple.	0
178	PELOSI	Of course we do.	0
179	TRUMP	We need border security.	0
180	PELOSI	We do.	0
181	TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.	0
182	TRUMP	We have terrorists.	0
183	TRUMP	We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.	1
184	TRUMP	Ten.	0
185	TRUMP	These are very serious people.	0
186	TRUMP	Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.	0
187	TRUMP	But we caught 10 terrorists.	0
188	TRUMP	These are people that were looking to do harm.	0
189	TRUMP	We need the wall.	0
190	TRUMP	We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.	0
191	TRUMP	But it's important.	0
192	TRUMP	Chuck, did you want to say something?	0
193	SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
194	SCHUMER	Here's what I want to say:	0
195	SCHUMER	We have a lot of disagreements here.	0
196	SCHUMER	The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.	0
197	SCHUMER	But that's not the point here.	0
198	SCHUMER	We have a disagreement about the wall —	0
199	TRUMP	Well, the Washington Post —	0
200	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
201	SCHUMER	— whether it's effective or it isn't.	0
202	SCHUMER	Not on border security, but on the wall.	0
203	SCHUMER	We do not want to shut down the government.	0
204	SCHUMER	You have called 20 times to shut down the government.	0
205	SCHUMER	You say, "I want to shut down the government."	0
206	SCHUMER	We don't.	0
207	SCHUMER	We want to come to an agreement.	0
208	SCHUMER	If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.	0
209	SCHUMER	And that's what we're urging you to do.	0
210	SCHUMER	Not threaten to shut down the government —	0
211	TRUMP	Chuck —	0
212	SCHUMER	— because you —	0
213	TRUMP	You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.	0
214	SCHUMER	Let me just finish.	0
215	SCHUMER	Because you can't get your way.	0
216	TRUMP	Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.	0
217	SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
218	SCHUMER	Let me say something, Mr. President.	0
219	SCHUMER	You just say, "My way, or we'll shut down the government."	0
220	SCHUMER	We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.	0
221	SCHUMER	We urge you to take it.	0
222	TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
223	PELOSI	It is good border security.	0
224	SCHUMER	It is very good border security.	0
225	TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
226	PELOSI	It's actually what the border security asked for.	0
227	SCHUMER	It's what the border —	0
228	TRUMP	Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —	0
229	SCHUMER	You just said it is effective.	0
230	TRUMP	Can I be — can I tell you something?	0
231	SCHUMER	Yeah, you just said it's effective.	0
232	TRUMP	Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.	0
233	SCHUMER	We want to do this —	0
234	TRUMP	Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.	0
235	TRUMP	Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.	0
236	PELOSI	Wait a second.	0
237	PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.	0
238	SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
239	PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.	0
240	PELOSI	We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch.	0
241	PELOSI	We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.	0
242	SCHUMER	Open.	0
243	TRUMP	We're going to keep it open —	0
244	PELOSI	The American —	0
245	TRUMP	— if we have border security.	0
246	PELOSI	The American —	0
247	TRUMP	If we don't have border security, Chuck —	0
248	PELOSI	I'm with you.	0
249	TRUMP	— we're not going to keep it open.	0
250	PELOSI	I'm with you.	0
251	PELOSI	We are going to have border security.	0
252	SCHUMER	And it's the same border –	0
253	PELOSI	Effective border security.	0
254	SCHUMER	You're bragging about what has been done.	0
255	TRUMP	By us.	0
256	SCHUMER	We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.	0
257	SCHUMER	That's our proposal.	0
258	SCHUMER	If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.	0
259	TRUMP	Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.	0
260	SCHUMER	Let's debate —	0
261	PELOSI	We have taken —	0
262	SCHUMER	Let's debate in private.	0
263	PELOSI	We have taken this conversation —	0
264	SCHUMER	Okay?	0
265	TRUMP	Okay.	0
266	SCHUMER	Yeah.	0
267	PELOSI	— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.	0
268	PELOSI	And we can dispel that.	0
269	TRUMP	We need border security.	0
270	TRUMP	And I think we all agree that we need border security.	0
271	SCHUMER	Yes, we do.	0
272	TRUMP	Is that right?	0
273	SCHUMER	We do.	0
274	TRUMP	See?	0
275	TRUMP	We get along.	0
276	TRUMP	Thank you, everybody.	0

279	QUESTION	You say border security and the wall.	0
280	QUESTION	Can you have border security without the wall?	0
281	QUESTION	There's a commonality on border security.	0
282	TRUMP	No, you need the wall.	0
283	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
284	QUESTION	Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?	0
285	SCHUMER	Yes.	0
286	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
287	TRUMP	We need border security.	0
288	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
289	TRUMP	You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.	0
290	PELOSI	That's simply not true.	0
291	PELOSI	That is a political promise.	0
292	PELOSI	Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.	1
293	SCHUMER	And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.	1
294	TRUMP	It totally solves the problem.	0
295	PELOSI	Again, but I don't want to take this —	0
296	TRUMP	And it's very important.	0
297	PELOSI	Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, "How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"	0

314	TRUMP	We did win North Dakota.	0
315	PELOSI	This is the most unfortunate thing.	0
316	PELOSI	We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.	0
317	TRUMP	But it's not bad, Nancy.	0
318	PELOSI	Let us — no, but it's —	0
319	TRUMP	It's called transparency.	0
320	PELOSI	I know.	0
321	PELOSI	But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.	0
322	PELOSI	And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —	0
323	TRUMP	You know what?	0
324	TRUMP	We need border security.	0
325	PELOSI	— without saying to the public, "This isn't true."	0
326	TRUMP	That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.	0
327	TRUMP	If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.	0
328	TRUMP	This country needs border security.	0
329	PELOSI	We agree with that.	0
330	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.	0
331	SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)	0
332	TRUMP	Let's have a talk.	0

334	QUESTION	Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?	0
335	QUESTION	Is that the —	0
336	TRUMP	It's a big section.	0
337	TRUMP	It's a big part of it.	0
338	QUESTION	Is it everything that you need?	0
339	TRUMP	It's a big part of it.	0
340	TRUMP	We need to have effective border security.	0
341	TRUMP	We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.	0
342	QUESTION	How much money, Mr. President?	0
343	TRUMP	We are doing it much under budget.	0
344	TRUMP	We're actually way under —	0

353	TRUMP	Well, we're going to see.	0
