30	QUINTANILLA	A lot to get to tonight.	0
31	QUINTANILLA	So let's get started.	0
32	QUINTANILLA	This first is an open question.	0
33	QUINTANILLA	This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people.	0
34	QUINTANILLA	And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, "what's your biggest weakness?"	0
35	QUINTANILLA	So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that you're a perfectionist...	0
36	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
37	QUINTANILLA	...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it?	0
38	QUINTANILLA	We'll go left to right.	0
39	QUINTANILLA	Governor Kasich, 30 seconds.	0
40	KASICH	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.	0
41	KASICH	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out — out in the — in the cold.	0
42	KASICH	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 — people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.	0
43	KASICH	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in — in a deeper hole than they are today.	0
44	KASICH	We need somebody who can lead.	0
45	KASICH	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...	0
46	QUINTANILLA	Governor?	0
47	KASICH	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.	0
48	KASICH	country moving again.	0
49	QUINTANILLA	Governor Huckabee.	0
50	HUCKABEE	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.	0
51	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
52	HUCKABEE	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.	0
53	HUCKABEE	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.	0
54	HUCKABEE	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.	0
55	HUCKABEE	Play by the rules.	0
56	HUCKABEE	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.	0
57	QUINTANILLA	Thank you, Governor.	0
58	QUINTANILLA	Governor Bush.	0
59	BUSH	You know, I am by my nature impatient.	0
60	BUSH	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.	0
61	BUSH	You gotta be patient.	0
62	BUSH	You gotta be — stick with it, and all that.	0
63	BUSH	But also, I can't fake anger.	0
64	BUSH	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.	0
65	BUSH	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.	0
66	BUSH	It's never been that way in American politics before.	0
67	BUSH	I can't do it.	0
68	BUSH	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply — you know, going down.	0
69	BUSH	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.	0
70	QUINTANILLA	Senator Rubio.	0
71	RUBIO	Thank you for that question.	0
72	RUBIO	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.	0
73	RUBIO	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.	0
74	RUBIO	And that doesn't have to be true.	0
75	RUBIO	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.	0
76	RUBIO	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.	0
77	QUINTANILLA	Mr. Trump?	0
78	TRUMP	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.	0
79	TRUMP	I'm too trusting.	0
80	TRUMP	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.	0
81	TRUMP	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.	0
82	TRUMP	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."	0
83	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
84	QUINTANILLA	Dr. Carson?	0
85	CARSON	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.	0
86	CARSON	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.	0
87	CARSON	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.	0
88	QUINTANILLA	Mrs. Fiorina?	0
89	FIORINA	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.	0
90	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
91	QUINTANILLA	Fixed it.	0
92	FIORINA	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.	0
93	FIORINA	I agree with them.	0
94	FIORINA	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.	0
95	FIORINA	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.	0
96	FIORINA	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.	0
97	FIORINA	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.	0
98	FIORINA	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.	0
99	QUINTANILLA	Senator Cruz?	0
100	CRUZ	I'm too agreeable, easy going.	0
101	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
102	CRUZ	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.	0
103	CRUZ	I'm a fighter.	0
104	CRUZ	I am passionate about what I believe.	0
105	CRUZ	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.	0
106	CRUZ	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.	0
107	CRUZ	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.	0
108	CRUZ	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.	0
109	QUINTANILLA	Governor Christie?	0
110	CHRISTIE	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.	0
111	CHRISTIE	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.	0
112	CHRISTIE	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.	0
113	CHRISTIE	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.	0
114	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
115	CHRISTIE	But I will — but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.	1
116	CHRISTIE	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.	0
117	CHRISTIE	But I know who the pessimist is.	0
118	CHRISTIE	It's Hillary Clinton.	0
119	CHRISTIE	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.	0
120	CHRISTIE	Take it to the bank.	0
121	QUINTANILLA	Senator Paul?	0
122	PAUL	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.	0
123	PAUL	We borrow a million dollars a minute.	0
124	PAUL	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.	0
125	PAUL	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.	0
126	PAUL	I will stand firm.	0
127	PAUL	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.	0
128	PAUL	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.	0
129	PAUL	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.	0
130	QUINTANILLA	Thanks to all the candidates.	0
131	QUINTANILLA	John?	0
132	HARWOOD	Mr. Trump, you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.	0
133	TRUMP	Right.	0
134	HARWOOD	Send 11 million people out of the country.	0
135	HARWOOD	Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.	0
136	TRUMP	Right.	0
137	HARWOOD	And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.	0
138	TRUMP	That's right.	0
139	HARWOOD	Let's be honest.	0
140	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
141	HARWOOD	Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?	0
142	TRUMP	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.	0
143	TRUMP	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.	0
144	TRUMP	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.	0
145	TRUMP	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.	0
146	TRUMP	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.	0
147	TRUMP	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.	0
148	TRUMP	We're going to create a border.	0
149	TRUMP	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.	0
150	TRUMP	They're going to come in legally.	0
151	TRUMP	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.	0
152	TRUMP	They built the great wall of China.	0
153	TRUMP	That's 13,000 miles.	0
154	TRUMP	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.	0
155	TRUMP	So we need 1,000.	0
156	TRUMP	We can do a wall.	0
157	TRUMP	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.	0
158	TRUMP	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.	0
159	TRUMP	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico — I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders — but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.	0
160	TRUMP	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?	0
161	TRUMP	A politician other than the people in the states — I don't want to — a politician cannot get them to pay.	0
162	TRUMP	I can.	0
163	TRUMP	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...	0
164	TRUMP	Excuse me, John.	0
165	TRUMP	... of $50 billion...	0
166	HARWOOD	We're at the 60 seconds.	0
167	TRUMP	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.	0
168	HARWOOD	We're at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan.	0
169	HARWOOD	You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...	0
170	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
171	HARWOOD	Hold on, hold on.	0
172	HARWOOD	The economy would take off like a rocket ship.	0
173	TRUMP	Right.	0
174	TRUMP	Dynamically.	0
175	HARWOOD	I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties.	0
176	HARWOOD	They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.	0
177	TRUMP	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.	0
178	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
179	HARWOOD	The Tax Foundation says — has looked at all of our plans and — and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit...	0
180	QUICK	Gentlemen — we'll — we'll get back to this — just a minute — just a minute we're gonna continue this.	0
181	QUICK	I wanna talk taxes...	0
182	QUINTANILLA	Hold it.	0
183	QUINTANILLA	We'll cut it back to you in just a minute.	0
184	QUINTANILLA	Becky's moving on.	0
185	QUICK	Dr. Carson, let's talk about taxes.	0
186	QUICK	You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and — I've looked at it — and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.	0
187	QUICK	If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion.	0
188	QUICK	That is less than half of what we bring in right now.	0
189	QUICK	And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.	0
190	QUICK	So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?	0
191	CARSON	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.	0
192	CARSON	I used the tithing analogy.	0
193	QUICK	I — I understand that, but if you — if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.	0
194	CARSON	The rate — the rate — the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.	0
195	QUICK	15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.	0
196	CARSON	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.	0
197	CARSON	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.	0
198	CARSON	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.	0
199	CARSON	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.	0
200	CARSON	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.	0
201	CARSON	That's gonna be the real growth engine.	0
202	CARSON	Stimulating the economy — because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...	0
203	QUICK	You'd have to cut — you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.	0
204	CARSON	That's not true.	0
205	QUICK	That is true, I looked at the numbers.	0
206	CARSON	When — when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.	0
207	QUICK	Dr. Carson, thank you.	0
208	KASICH	Listen, I want to just comment.	0
209	HARWOOD	Governor Kasich, hold it, I'm coming to you right now.	0
210	HARWOOD	The...	0
211	KASICH	Well I want to comment on this.	0
212	KASICH	This is the fantasy...	0
213	HARWOOD	Well, I'm asking you about this.	0
214	KASICH	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.	0
215	HARWOOD	I'm about to ask you about this.	0
216	HARWOOD	That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from.	0
217	HARWOOD	Would you repeat it?	0
218	KASICH	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.	0
219	KASICH	You can't do it with empty promised.	0
220	KASICH	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.	0
221	KASICH	I actually have a plan.	0
222	KASICH	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.	0
223	KASICH	You just don't make promises like this.	0
224	KASICH	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up — coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.	0
225	KASICH	We'll just clean it up.	0
226	KASICH	Where are you gonna clean it up?	0
227	KASICH	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.	0
228	KASICH	You gotta be creative and imaginative.	0
229	KASICH	Now, let me just be clear, John.	0
230	KASICH	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.	0
231	KASICH	We're up 347,000 jobs.	0
232	KASICH	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.	0
233	KASICH	I was the architect.	0
234	KASICH	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.	0
235	KASICH	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.	0
236	KASICH	That's was hard work.	0
237	KASICH	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.	0
238	KASICH	Creativity.	0
239	KASICH	This stuff is fantasy.	0
240	KASICH	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.	0
241	KASICH	Come on, that's just not — you scare senior citizens with that.	0
242	KASICH	It's not responsible.	0
243	HARWOOD	Well, let's just get more pointed about it.	0
244	HARWOOD	You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.	0
245	HARWOOD	Who were you talking about?	0
246	KASICH	Well, I mean right here.	0
247	KASICH	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?	0
248	KASICH	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?	0
249	KASICH	Or that we're just going to be great?	0
250	KASICH	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans — or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?	0
251	KASICH	Folks, we've got to wake up.	0
252	KASICH	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.	0
253	KASICH	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.	0
254	KASICH	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.	0
255	KASICH	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.	0
256	QUINTANILLA	Governor — Governor.	0
257	QUINTANILLA	thank you, Governor.	0
258	KASICH	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.	0
259	KASICH	And we will be strong again.	0
260	KASICH	Thank you.	0
261	QUINTANILLA	Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.	0
262	TRUMP	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?	0
263	TRUMP	He hit oil.	0
264	TRUMP	He got lucky with fracking.	0
265	TRUMP	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.	0
266	TRUMP	Number — and that is important for you to know.	0
267	TRUMP	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.	0
268	TRUMP	And Lehman Brothers started it all.	0
269	TRUMP	He was on the board.	0
270	TRUMP	And he was a managing general partner.	0
271	TRUMP	And just thirdly, he was so nice.	0
272	TRUMP	He was such a nice guy.	0
273	TRUMP	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.	0
274	TRUMP	But then his poll numbers tanked.	0
275	TRUMP	He has got — that is why he is on the end.	0
276	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
277	TRUMP	And he got nasty.	0
278	TRUMP	And he got nasty.	0
279	TRUMP	So you know what?	0
280	TRUMP	You can have him.	0
281	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
282	KASICH	Let me just — let me respond.	0
283	KASICH	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.	0
284	KASICH	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.	0
285	KASICH	We came back from the dead.	0
286	KASICH	And you know what?	0
287	KASICH	It works very, very well.	0
288	KASICH	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.	0
289	KASICH	I was a banker and I was proud of it.	0
290	KASICH	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.	0
291	KASICH	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.	0
292	KASICH	My state is doing great across the board.	0
293	KASICH	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...	0
294	QUICK	Governor...	0
295	KASICH	... an agreement with the...	0
296	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
297	KASICH	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.	0
298	KASICH	It's a joke.	0
299	QUINTANILLA	Thank you, Governor.	0
300	QUICK	Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...	0
301	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
302	CARSON	Since I was attacked too.	0
303	QUICK	Thank you.	0
304	CARSON	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.	0
305	CARSON	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.	0
306	CARSON	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.	0
307	CARSON	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.	0
308	CARSON	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.	0
309	CRUZ	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.	0
310	CRUZ	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.	0
311	CRUZ	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.	0
312	CRUZ	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.	0
313	CRUZ	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.	0
314	CRUZ	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.	0
315	CRUZ	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.	0
316	CRUZ	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.	0
317	CRUZ	Those are the hard numbers.	0

326	FIORINA	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?	0
327	FIORINA	We have been talking about it for decades.	0
328	FIORINA	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.	0
329	FIORINA	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.	0
330	FIORINA	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.	0
331	FIORINA	The problem is we never get it done.	0
332	FIORINA	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.	0
333	FIORINA	It never happens.	0
334	FIORINA	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.	0
335	FIORINA	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.	0
336	QUINTANILLA	You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?	0
337	FIORINA	That's right, three pages.	0
338	QUINTANILLA	Is that using really small type?	0
339	FIORINA	You know why three?	0
340	QUINTANILLA	Is that using really small type?	0
341	FIORINA	No.	0
342	FIORINA	You know why three?	0
343	FIORINA	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.	0
344	FIORINA	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.	0
345	FIORINA	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.	0
346	FIORINA	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform —	0
347	QUINTANILLA	Mrs. Fiorina —	0
348	FIORINA	— the issue is who is going to get it done.	0

353	QUINTANILLA	This one is for Senator Rubio.	0
354	QUINTANILLA	You've been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s.	0
355	QUINTANILLA	You've had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don't support anymore.	0
356	QUINTANILLA	Now, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president.	0
357	QUINTANILLA	Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?	0
358	RUBIO	That's an interesting question.	0
359	RUBIO	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.	0
360	RUBIO	Why don't you wait in line?	0
361	RUBIO	Wait for what?	0
362	RUBIO	This country is running out of time.	0
363	RUBIO	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.	0
364	RUBIO	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
365	RUBIO	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.	0
366	RUBIO	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.	0
367	RUBIO	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.	1
368	RUBIO	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.	0
369	RUBIO	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.	0
370	RUBIO	We have a — they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?	0
371	RUBIO	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.	0
372	RUBIO	The time to act is now.	0
373	RUBIO	The time to turn the page is now.	0
374	RUBIO	If we — if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.	0
375	QUINTANILLA	So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?	0
376	RUBIO	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.	0
377	RUBIO	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.	0
378	QUINTANILLA	Well, do you hate your job?	0
379	RUBIO	Let me — let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.	0
380	RUBIO	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.	0
381	RUBIO	I don't recall them calling for his resignation —	0
382	QUINTANILLA	Is that the standard?	0
383	RUBIO	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.	0
384	RUBIO	I don't recall the Sun — in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.	0
385	RUBIO	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.	0
386	RUBIO	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.	0

390	BUSH	Could I — could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.	0
391	BUSH	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.	0
392	BUSH	He's a gifted politician.	0
393	BUSH	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.	0
394	BUSH	I mean, literally, the Senate — what is it, like a French work week?	0
395	BUSH	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?	0
396	BUSH	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.	0
397	BUSH	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.	0
398	RUBIO	I get to respond, right?	0
399	QUICK	Thirty seconds.	0
400	RUBIO	Well, it's interesting.	0
401	RUBIO	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.	0
402	RUBIO	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?	0
403	BUSH	He wasn't my senator.	0
404	RUBIO	No Jeb, I don't remember — well, let me tell you.	0
405	RUBIO	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.	0
406	RUBIO	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.	0
407	BUSH	Well, I've been —	0
408	RUBIO	Here's the bottom line.	0
409	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
410	RUBIO	I'm not — my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.	0
411	RUBIO	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.	0
412	RUBIO	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.	0
413	RUBIO	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.	0

426	HARWOOD	Governor, the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.	0
427	HARWOOD	You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people.	0
428	HARWOOD	I wanted to ask you —	0
429	BUSH	No, no.	0
430	BUSH	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.	0

436	HARWOOD	It's a — it's a question about why you're having difficulty.	0
437	HARWOOD	I want to ask you in this context.	0
438	HARWOOD	Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism.	0
439	HARWOOD	Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race?	0

447	BUSH	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.	0

454	QUICK	We'll get to everyone.	0
455	QUICK	Ms. Fiorina, I — I'd like to ask you a question.	0
456	QUICK	You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard.	0
457	QUICK	But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.	0
458	QUICK	Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left.	0
459	QUICK	Obviously, you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.	0
460	QUICK	I just wonder, in terms of all of that — you know, we look back, your board fired you.	0
461	QUICK	I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.	0
462	FIORINA	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent — 80 percent — and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.	0
463	FIORINA	I was recruited to H.P.	0
464	FIORINA	to save a company.	0
465	FIORINA	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.	0
466	FIORINA	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.	0
467	FIORINA	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.	0
468	FIORINA	's entrenched problems head-on.	0
469	FIORINA	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.	0
470	FIORINA	And yes, it was a very difficult time.	0
471	FIORINA	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business — like Gateway — taking all their jobs with them.	0
472	FIORINA	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.	0
473	FIORINA	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.	0
474	FIORINA	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.	0
475	FIORINA	There are politics in the boardroom as well.	0
476	FIORINA	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?	0
477	FIORINA	We were wrong.	0
478	FIORINA	She was right.	0
479	FIORINA	She was a great CEO.	0
480	FIORINA	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.	0
481	FIORINA	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.	0
482	QUICK	Mrs. Fiorina, it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...	0
483	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
484	QUICK	...he said a lot of very questionable things.	0
485	QUICK	Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.	0
486	QUICK	I think his quote was that, "if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes.	0
487	QUICK	If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes."	0
488	QUICK	Is this the type of person you want defending you?	0
489	FIORINA	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.	0
490	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
491	FIORINA	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.	0
492	FIORINA	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.	0
493	FIORINA	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.	0
494	FIORINA	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.	0
495	FIORINA	Imagine — imagine — if a politician were held to that standard of account.	0
496	FIORINA	I will run on my record all day long.	0
497	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
498	FIORINA	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...	0
499	QUICK	Mrs. Fiorina.	0
500	FIORINA	...and be held accountable.	0
501	QUICK	Thank you, we're out of time.	0

557	CRUZ	You're not interested in an answer.	0
558	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
559	HARWOOD	Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit.	0
560	HARWOOD	Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough?	0
561	PAUL	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.	0
562	PAUL	That's what they're doing.	0
563	PAUL	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.	0
564	PAUL	Here's the thing.	0
565	PAUL	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.	0
566	PAUL	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.	0
567	PAUL	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.	0
568	PAUL	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.	0
569	PAUL	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.	0
570	PAUL	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.	0
571	PAUL	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.	0
572	HARWOOD	Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?	0
573	PAUL	Well, that's a real question.	0
574	PAUL	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?	0
575	PAUL	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.	0
576	PAUL	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.	0
577	PAUL	Well, you know what I'm worried about?	0
578	PAUL	Not keeping the government open.	0
579	PAUL	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.	0
580	PAUL	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.	0
581	PAUL	That is important.	0
582	PAUL	And that's what we have to contrast.	0

592	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]	0
593	QUICK	.	0
594	QUICK	In your tell it like it is campaign, you've said a lot of tough things.	0
595	QUICK	You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security.	0
596	QUICK	You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.	0
597	QUICK	Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned.	0
598	QUICK	It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?	0
599	CHRISTIE	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.	0
600	CHRISTIE	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.	0
601	CHRISTIE	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.	0
602	CHRISTIE	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.	0
603	CHRISTIE	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.	0
604	CHRISTIE	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.	0
605	CHRISTIE	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.	0
606	CHRISTIE	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.	0
607	CHRISTIE	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.	0
608	CHRISTIE	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.	0
609	CHRISTIE	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.	0
610	CHRISTIE	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.	0
611	CHRISTIE	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.	0
612	CHRISTIE	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?	0
613	CHRISTIE	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.	0
614	CHRISTIE	We need to get realistic about this.	0
615	CHRISTIE	We're not — the American people — forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.	0
616	CHRISTIE	And...	0
617	QUICK	...Governor...	0

626	HUCKABEE	It's their money.	0
627	HUCKABEE	This isn't the governments money.	0
628	HUCKABEE	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.	0
629	HUCKABEE	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.	0
630	HUCKABEE	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.	0
631	HUCKABEE	Now, we're going to blame the people.	0
632	HUCKABEE	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.	0
633	HUCKABEE	That makes no sense to everybody.	0
634	HUCKABEE	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."	0
635	HUCKABEE	No their not.	0
636	HUCKABEE	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."	0
637	HUCKABEE	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.	0
638	HUCKABEE	But, let me tell you who not to blame.	0
639	HUCKABEE	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.	0
640	HUCKABEE	Let's quit making it a problem for them.	0
641	HUCKABEE	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.	0

680	CRUZ	Well, sure.	0
681	CRUZ	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.	0
682	CRUZ	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.	0
683	CRUZ	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.	0
684	CRUZ	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers — look.	0
685	CRUZ	I'm 44 years old.	0
686	CRUZ	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.	0
687	CRUZ	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.	0
688	QUINTANILLA	30 seconds, Governor Huckabee.	0
689	HUCKABEE	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.	0
690	HUCKABEE	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.	0
691	HUCKABEE	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.	0
692	HUCKABEE	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?	0
693	HUCKABEE	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.	0
694	HUCKABEE	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.	0
695	HUCKABEE	They expect to have it.	0
696	HUCKABEE	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.	0

703	QUICK	Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans.	0
704	QUICK	We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.	0
705	QUICK	Folks, we'll get right back into this.	0
706	QUICK	Mr. Trump, let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies.	0
707	QUICK	Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times.	0
708	QUICK	In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this.	0
709	QUICK	You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did.	0
710	QUICK	But some of the individuals — the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn't fare so well.	0
711	QUICK	Bankruptcy is a broken promise.	0
712	QUICK	Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now?	0
713	TRUMP	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.	0
714	TRUMP	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.	0
715	TRUMP	Atlantic City has gone bad.	0
716	TRUMP	I mean, Chris will know about that.	0
717	TRUMP	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.	0
718	TRUMP	Caesar's — excuse me — Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.	0
719	TRUMP	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy — the biggest.	0
720	TRUMP	But also the biggest people (ph) — now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.	0
721	TRUMP	I never filed for bankruptcy.	0
722	TRUMP	But many, many people did.	0
723	TRUMP	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.	0
724	TRUMP	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.	0
725	TRUMP	I've used it three times, maybe four times.	0
726	TRUMP	Came out great.	0
727	TRUMP	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.	0
728	TRUMP	That is what I could do for the country.	0
729	TRUMP	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.	0
730	TRUMP	Nobody can solve it like me.	0
731	TRUMP	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.	0
732	TRUMP	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.	0
733	TRUMP	And I'm glad I did it.	0
734	TRUMP	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.	0
735	QUICK	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
736	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
737	CRAMER	Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs.	0
738	CRAMER	You have spent a lifetime in medicine.	0
739	CRAMER	Have these companies gone too far?	0
740	CRAMER	Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?	0
741	CARSON	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.	0
742	CARSON	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?	0
743	CARSON	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.	0
744	CARSON	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.	1
745	CARSON	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.	0
746	CARSON	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.	0
747	CARSON	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.	0
748	CRAMER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
749	CRAMER	Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.	0
750	CRAMER	But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect.	0
751	CRAMER	One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches.	0
752	CRAMER	No one went to jail.	0
753	CRAMER	As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?	0
754	CHRISTIE	You bet they do.	0
755	CHRISTIE	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.	0
756	CHRISTIE	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.	0
757	CHRISTIE	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.	0
758	CHRISTIE	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.	0
759	CHRISTIE	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.	0
760	CHRISTIE	It's a political Justice Department.	0
761	CHRISTIE	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.	0
762	CHRISTIE	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.	0
763	CHRISTIE	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.	0
764	CHRISTIE	And to expand on Mr. Carson's — or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.	0
765	CHRISTIE	We don't need newer (ph) laws.	0
766	CHRISTIE	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for — again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?	0
767	CHRISTIE	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.	0
768	CHRISTIE	Let's let a Justice Department — and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.	0
769	CHRISTIE	It will be a way of life.	0
770	CRAMER	Thank you, Governor Christie.	0
771	HARWOOD	Jim, thanks.	0
772	HARWOOD	Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.	0
773	HARWOOD	A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal.	0
774	HARWOOD	Still feel that way?	0
775	BUSH	Well, the deal was done.	0
776	BUSH	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.	0
777	BUSH	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.	0
778	BUSH	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.	0
779	BUSH	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.	0
780	BUSH	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.	0
781	BUSH	We need to reverse that.	0
782	BUSH	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.	0
783	BUSH	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.	0
784	BUSH	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.	0
785	BUSH	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.	0
786	HARWOOD	But to — to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar...	0
787	BUSH	You find me...	0
788	HARWOOD	...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?	0
789	BUSH	You find me a Democrat — you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?	0
790	BUSH	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.	0
791	BUSH	I'll talk to them.	0
792	HARWOOD	So you don't want the coach to put you in any more?	0
793	BUSH	Look, the — the deal is already done.	0
794	BUSH	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.	0
795	BUSH	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes — cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.	0

799	QUINTANILLA	Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea.	0
800	QUINTANILLA	Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree.	0
801	QUINTANILLA	Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?	0
802	FIORINA	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.	0
803	FIORINA	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.	0
804	FIORINA	What's crony capitalism?	0
805	FIORINA	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.	0
806	FIORINA	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?	0
807	FIORINA	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?	0
808	FIORINA	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless — in this case, 1,590 community banks — go out of business.	0
809	FIORINA	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.	0
810	FIORINA	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.	0
811	FIORINA	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.	0
812	FIORINA	The student loan problem has been created by government.	0
813	FIORINA	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.	0
814	FIORINA	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.	0
815	FIORINA	But guess who pushed for that regulation?	0
816	FIORINA	The big Internet companies.	0
817	FIORINA	This is what's going on.	0
818	FIORINA	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.	0
819	FIORINA	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.	0
820	FIORINA	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.	0
821	FIORINA	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.	0
822	FIORINA	It's why you see the banks consolidating.	0
823	FIORINA	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.	0
824	FIORINA	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.	0
825	FIORINA	Community banks are going out of business.	0
826	FIORINA	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.	0
827	QUINTANILLA	Mrs. Fiorina.	0
828	FIORINA	It is why we have to simplify.	0
829	FIORINA	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.	0
830	QUINTANILLA	OK.	0
831	FIORINA	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.	0

835	QUICK	You have a lack of bookkeeping skills.	0
836	QUICK	You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money.	0
837	QUICK	You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought.	0
838	QUICK	And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund.	0
839	QUICK	That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.	0
840	QUICK	In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy.	0
841	QUICK	What do you say?	0
842	RUBIO	Well, you just — you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.	1
843	RUBIO	But I'm going to tell you the truth.	0
844	RUBIO	Here's the truth.	0
845	RUBIO	I didn't inherit any money.	0
846	RUBIO	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.	0
847	RUBIO	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.	0
848	RUBIO	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.	0
849	RUBIO	I had to work my way through school.	0
850	RUBIO	I had to borrow money to go to school.	0
851	RUBIO	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.	0
852	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
853	RUBIO	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.	0
854	RUBIO	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family — a better life for our family.	0
855	RUBIO	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.	0
856	RUBIO	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.	0
857	RUBIO	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.	0
858	RUBIO	And that's what this economy needs to — that's what this debate needs to be about.	0
859	RUBIO	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.	0
860	QUICK	Senator, I understand all of that.	0
861	QUICK	I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too.	0
862	QUICK	But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't.	0
863	QUICK	You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.	0
864	RUBIO	And I used it to pay off my loans.	0
865	RUBIO	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.	0
866	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
867	QUICK	But you — but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed.	0
868	QUICK	That — that was after you'd already come into that windfall.	0
869	QUICK	That's why I raised the question.	0
870	RUBIO	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.	0
871	RUBIO	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.	0
872	RUBIO	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.	0
873	RUBIO	And I make a lot more than the average American.	0
874	RUBIO	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.	0
875	RUBIO	We can't afford another four years of that.	0
876	RUBIO	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.	0
877	RUBIO	Thank you, senator.	0
878	HARWOOD	Governor John Kasich, you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors.	0
879	HARWOOD	You call that corporate welfare.	0
880	HARWOOD	One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that's corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort — jobs Ohio.	0
881	HARWOOD	If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?	0
882	KASICH	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.	0
883	KASICH	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.	0
884	KASICH	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.	0
885	KASICH	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state — $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.	0
886	KASICH	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.	0
887	KASICH	This is the same old stuff since I left.	0
888	KASICH	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.	0
889	KASICH	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.	0
890	KASICH	We actually did it.	0
891	KASICH	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.	0
892	KASICH	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.	0
893	KASICH	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.	0
894	KASICH	So what I will tell you about our incentives — our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.	0
895	KASICH	And you know what?	0
896	KASICH	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country — I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...	0
897	HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.	0
898	KASICH	...	0
899	KASICH	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.	0

901	HARWOOD	Thank you.	0
902	QUICK	Yes, thank you John.	0

904	QUICK	And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause.	0
905	QUICK	But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes.	0
906	QUICK	I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?	0
907	CRUZ	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.	0
908	CRUZ	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.	0
909	CRUZ	You know, you look at women working.	0
910	CRUZ	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.	0
911	CRUZ	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.	0
912	CRUZ	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.	0
913	CRUZ	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.	0
914	CRUZ	But I — the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.	0
915	CRUZ	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.	0
916	CRUZ	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.	1
917	CRUZ	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.	0
918	CRUZ	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.	0
919	CRUZ	That is who I'm fighting for.	0
920	CRUZ	The people that Washington leaves behind.	0

936	QUINTANILLA	Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.	0
937	QUINTANILLA	Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?	0
938	CARSON	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.	0
939	CARSON	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.	0
940	CARSON	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.	0
941	CARSON	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.	0
942	CARSON	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.	0
943	CARSON	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.	0
944	CARSON	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.	0
945	CARSON	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.	0

951	QUINTANILLA	Why?	0
952	CARSON	Well, that's easy to answer.	0
953	CARSON	I didn't have an involvement with them.	0
954	CARSON	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.	0
955	CARSON	Total propaganda.	0
956	CARSON	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.	0

974	HARWOOD	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.	0
975	HARWOOD	Senator Huckabee, I mean — excuse me — Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the headline, "Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industry's savior."	0
976	HARWOOD	It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.	0
977	HARWOOD	But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans.	0
978	HARWOOD	Why is he wrong?	0
979	RUBIO	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.	0
980	RUBIO	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.	0
981	RUBIO	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.	0
982	RUBIO	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.	0
983	RUBIO	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.	0
984	RUBIO	But here's the best solution of all.	0
985	RUBIO	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.	0
986	RUBIO	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.	0
987	RUBIO	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.	0
988	RUBIO	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those — those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.	0
989	RUBIO	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.	0
990	HARWOOD	It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn't...	0
991	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
992	RUBIO	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.	0
993	HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator.	0

1052	RUBIO	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.	0

1058	QUICK	Senator Rubio, thank you very much.	0
1059	QUICK	I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.	0
1060	SANTELLI	Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve.	0
1061	SANTELLI	You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency.	0
1062	SANTELLI	Where do you want to take that?	0
1063	SANTELLI	Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely?	0
1064	SANTELLI	What are your thoughts?	0
1065	SANTELLI	What do you believe?	0
1066	CRUZ	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.	0
1067	CRUZ	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.	0
1068	CRUZ	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.	0
1069	CRUZ	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.	0
1070	CRUZ	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.	0
1071	CRUZ	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.	0
1072	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.	0
1073	CRUZ	It's driving up stock prices.	0
1074	CRUZ	Wall Street is doing great.	0
1075	CRUZ	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.	0
1076	CRUZ	But if you look at working men and women.	0
1077	CRUZ	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.	0
1078	CRUZ	She sees her cost of electricity going up.	0
1079	CRUZ	She sees her health insurance going up.	0
1080	CRUZ	And loose money is one of the major problems.	0
1081	CRUZ	We need sound money.	0
1082	CRUZ	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.	0
1083	SANTELLI	Senator Paul, the same question to you.	0
1084	PAUL	Well, thank you very much.	0
1085	PAUL	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.	0
1086	PAUL	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.	0
1087	PAUL	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.	0
1088	PAUL	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.	0
1089	PAUL	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.	0
1090	PAUL	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.	0
1091	PAUL	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.	0
1092	PAUL	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.	0
1093	PAUL	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.	0
1094	PAUL	What you need to do is free up interest rates.	0
1095	PAUL	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.	0
1096	SANTELLI	Thank you, Senator.	0
1097	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1098	SANTELLI	Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you don't like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market.	0
1099	SANTELLI	But you've also said that you're in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.	0
1100	SANTELLI	Isn't that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?	0
1101	CARSON	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.	0
1102	CARSON	I have studied that issue in great detail.	0
1103	CARSON	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.	0
1104	CARSON	And — you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers — this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of — great deal of problems for our society right now.	0
1105	CARSON	And — and — you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.	0
1106	CARSON	The reason that I — I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.	0
1107	CARSON	That cost gets passed on to the people.	0
1108	CARSON	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?	0
1109	CARSON	It's poor people and middle class.	0
1110	CARSON	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.	0
1111	CARSON	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.	0
1112	CARSON	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.	0
1113	SANTELLI	Thank you, Doctor.	0
1114	SANTELLI	Becky?	0
1115	QUICK	Rick, thank you very much.	0
1116	QUICK	Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality.	0
1117	QUICK	You've said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.	0
1118	QUICK	Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.	0
1119	HUCKABEE	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.	0
1120	HUCKABEE	In fact, that's part of the problem.	0
1121	HUCKABEE	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.	0
1122	HUCKABEE	I mean, what we had was something the government made — basically a bag of gas — that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.	0
1123	HUCKABEE	That is our government today.	0
1124	HUCKABEE	We saw it in the blimp.	0
1125	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1126	HUCKABEE	That's exactly what we saw.	0
1127	HUCKABEE	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.	0
1128	HUCKABEE	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.	0
1129	HUCKABEE	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.	0
1130	HUCKABEE	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.	0
1131	QUICK	Governor?	0
1132	HUCKABEE	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...	0
1133	QUICK	Governor?	0
1134	HUCKABEE	...is paid — played fairly.	0
1135	QUICK	Thank you.	0
1136	HUCKABEE	Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky.	0
1137	QUICK	All right, Governor Huckabee.	0
1138	HUCKABEE	Let me just close it out this way.	0
1139	QUICK	How about 15 more seconds?	0
1140	HUCKABEE	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.	0
1141	HUCKABEE	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about — we haven't talked about it tonight.	0
1142	HUCKABEE	Why aren't we talking about — instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people — why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...	0
1143	QUICK	Governor?	0
1144	HUCKABEE	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"	0
1145	QUICK	Governor, I'm sorry...	0
1146	HUCKABEE	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.	0
1147	QUICK	Governor, thank you.	0
1148	HUCKABEE	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.	0

1150	QUICK	Governor, thank you.	0
1151	QUICK	Appreciate it.	0
1152	QUICK	John?	0
1153	HARWOOD	Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent — just like your plan does.	0
1154	HARWOOD	But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.	0
1155	HARWOOD	Given the problems we've been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?	0
1156	BUSH	Look, the — the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.	0
1157	BUSH	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.	0
1158	BUSH	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and — and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.	0
1159	BUSH	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost — that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.	0
1160	BUSH	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.	0
1161	BUSH	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.	0
1162	BUSH	The government has tried it their way.	0
1163	BUSH	Under — under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.	0
1164	BUSH	We need to take a new approach of taxing — reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our — in our country before it's too late.	0
1165	HARWOOD	Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.	0
1166	HARWOOD	The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.	0
1167	HARWOOD	Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward?	0
1168	RUBIO	No, that's — you're wrong.	0
1169	RUBIO	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.	0
1170	RUBIO	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.	0
1171	RUBIO	Number one, you have people in this country that...	0

1182	HARWOOD	And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.	0
1183	RUBIO	Yeah, but that — because the math is, if you — 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.	0

1185	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]	0
1186	RUBIO	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.	0
1187	RUBIO	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.	0
1188	RUBIO	We are lowering taxes on small business.	0

1216	PAUL	Alright.	0
1217	PAUL	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.	0
1218	PAUL	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.	0
1219	PAUL	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.	0
1220	PAUL	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.	0
1221	PAUL	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.	0
1222	PAUL	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.	0

1240	QUINTANILLA	We're broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year.	0
1241	QUINTANILLA	Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he's said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they're just now paying taxes.	0
1242	QUINTANILLA	Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you'd like to have?	0
1243	KASICH	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.	0
1244	KASICH	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.	0
1245	KASICH	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.	0
1246	KASICH	We could do a whole show on that.	0
1247	KASICH	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.	0
1248	KASICH	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.	0
1249	KASICH	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.	0
1250	KASICH	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.	0
1251	KASICH	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.	0

1273	TRUMP	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.	0
1274	TRUMP	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect — and actually some of these folks I really like a lot — but I'm the only one that can say that.	0
1275	TRUMP	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given — if I'm given the opportunity to be president.	0

1289	RUBIO	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.	0
1290	RUBIO	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.	0
1291	RUBIO	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.	0
1292	RUBIO	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.	0
1293	RUBIO	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.	0
1294	RUBIO	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.	0

1315	TRUMP	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.	0
1316	TRUMP	They look around for gun-free zones.	0
1317	TRUMP	You know, we could give you another example — the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.	0
1318	TRUMP	Two of them were among the most highly decorated — they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.	0
1319	TRUMP	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.	0
1320	TRUMP	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.	0
1321	TRUMP	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.	0
1322	TRUMP	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.	0
1323	TRUMP	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.	0
1324	QUINTANILLA	We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that — that do not allow guns with or without a permit.	0

1368	CHRISTIE	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.	0
1369	CHRISTIE	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.	0
1370	CHRISTIE	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?	0
1371	CHRISTIE	Does he stand up for law enforcement?	0
1372	CHRISTIE	No, he doesn't.	0
1373	CHRISTIE	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.	0
1374	CHRISTIE	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.	0
1375	CHRISTIE	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.	0
1376	HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.	0
1377	HARWOOD	Don't forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.	0
1378	EPPERSON	Thank you, John.	0
1379	EPPERSON	Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees.	0
1380	EPPERSON	But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan.	0
1381	EPPERSON	That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy.	0
1382	EPPERSON	Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers?	0
1383	FIORINA	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.	0
1384	FIORINA	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.	0
1385	FIORINA	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.	0
1386	FIORINA	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.	0
1387	FIORINA	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.	0
1388	FIORINA	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.	0
1389	FIORINA	How great is that?	0
1390	FIORINA	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.	0
1391	FIORINA	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.	0
1392	FIORINA	And why?	0
1393	FIORINA	They cite Obamacare.	0
1394	FIORINA	They are refusing to...	0
1395	EPPERSON	So you wouldn't agree — you wouldn't agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that?	0
1396	FIORINA	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).	0
1397	FIORINA	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.	0
1398	FIORINA	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up — retirement plans.	0
1399	FIORINA	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...	0

1415	EPPERSON	What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?	0
1416	KASICH	Well, first of all, in Ohio we're changing the whole system.	0
1417	KASICH	Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or — graduates or completes a course.	0
1418	KASICH	Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that.	0
1419	KASICH	And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities.	0
1420	KASICH	And let me give you an example.	0
1421	KASICH	Universities today have so many non-academic assets.	0
1422	KASICH	At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business.	0
1423	KASICH	They shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business.	0
1424	KASICH	And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.	0
1425	KASICH	Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service.	0
1426	KASICH	I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do.	0
1427	KASICH	And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.	0
1428	KASICH	This is a big moral issue in America.	0
1429	KASICH	Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice.	0
1430	KASICH	And people can learn it through public service.	0

1449	BUSH	But we're not gambling.	0
1450	BUSH	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.	0
1451	BUSH	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.	0
1452	BUSH	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.	0
1453	BUSH	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.	0

1487	CHRISTIE	So... 	0
1488	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
1489	CHRISTIE	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.	0
1490	CHRISTIE	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.	0
1491	CHRISTIE	Why?	0
1492	CHRISTIE	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.	0
1493	CHRISTIE	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.	0
1494	CHRISTIE	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.	0
1495	CHRISTIE	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.	0

1499	QUICK	Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan.	0
1500	QUICK	He warned that it would lead to socialism.	0
1501	QUICK	Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?	0
1502	PAUL	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?	0
1503	PAUL	And what distributes goods better?	0
1504	PAUL	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.	0
1505	PAUL	Is there an area for a safety net?	0
1506	PAUL	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?	0
1507	PAUL	Yes.	0
1508	PAUL	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.	0
1509	PAUL	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.	0
1510	PAUL	But the average person takes out about $350,000.	0
1511	PAUL	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.	0
1512	PAUL	When people ask me, whose fault is it?	0
1513	PAUL	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?	0
1514	PAUL	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.	0

1516	PAUL	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.	0

1518	PAUL	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.	0
1519	PAUL	It's not working.	0
1520	PAUL	I have a bill to fix Medicare.	0
1521	PAUL	I've a bill to fix Social Security.	0
1522	PAUL	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.	0
1523	PAUL	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.	0

1531	QUICK	Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.	0
1532	QUICK	Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security.	0
1533	QUICK	Your time, sir.	0
1534	HUCKABEE	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.	0
1535	HUCKABEE	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.	0
1536	HUCKABEE	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.	0
1537	HUCKABEE	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.	0
1538	HUCKABEE	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio — when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.	0
1539	HUCKABEE	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?	0
1540	HUCKABEE	We didn't spend any.	0
1541	HUCKABEE	We've saved billions of dollars.	0
1542	HUCKABEE	You want to fix Medicare?	0
1543	HUCKABEE	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.	0
1544	HUCKABEE	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.	0
1545	HUCKABEE	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.	0
1546	BUSH	Becky —	0
1547	QUICK	Thank you, Governor.	0
1548	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1549	BUSH	— the governor's absolutely right.	0
1550	BUSH	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.	0
1551	BUSH	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.	0
1552	BUSH	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.	0
1553	HARWOOD	Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don't have to be touched.	0
1554	HARWOOD	Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?	0
1555	TRUMP	Yes, it's very simple.	0
1556	TRUMP	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.	0
1557	TRUMP	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.	0
1558	TRUMP	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.	0
1559	TRUMP	We're going to cut costs.	0
1560	TRUMP	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.	0
1561	UNKNOWN	Governor, you just heard him.	0
1562	BUSH	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.	0
1563	BUSH	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.	0
1564	BUSH	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.	0
1565	BUSH	It took — it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).	0
1566	BUSH	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.	0
1567	BUSH	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.	0
1568	KASICH	John.	0
1569	BUSH	But the idea that you can't — that you're just gonna grow your way out of this — I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.	0
1570	UNKNOWN	Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds?	0
1571	KASICH	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.	0
1572	KASICH	And so much of what we did — to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups — can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?	0
1573	KASICH	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.	0
1574	KASICH	We can make a stronger program.	0
1575	KASICH	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.	0
1576	KASICH	You can't grow your way out of demographics.	0
1577	KASICH	But we can give people better health care.	0
1578	KASICH	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating — keep giving...	0
1579	QUICK	Governor.	0
1580	KASICH	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?	0

1586	PAUL	You can't do nothing.	0
1587	PAUL	And that's what I hear from some people, we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."	0
1588	PAUL	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.	0
1589	PAUL	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.	0
1590	PAUL	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.	0
1591	PAUL	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.	0
1592	PAUL	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."	0
1593	PAUL	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.	0
1594	PAUL	There is no money in the Social Security account.	0
1595	PAUL	There is no money in the Medicare account.	0
1596	PAUL	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.	0

1599	HARWOOD	Hold on, Governor.	0
1600	HARWOOD	I've got a question for — for Dr. Carson.	0
1601	CARSON	About Medicare?	0
1602	HARWOOD	Yes.	0
1603	HARWOOD	You've said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.	0
1604	HARWOOD	Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea.	0
1605	HARWOOD	Explain how that would work, exactly.	0
1606	CARSON	Well, first of all the — the plan gives people the option of — of opting out.	0
1607	CARSON	But I think they will see a very good option here.	0
1608	CARSON	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.	0
1609	CARSON	And there are 48 million people involved — 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.	0
1610	CARSON	Divide that out.	0
1611	CARSON	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.	0
1612	CARSON	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.	0
1613	CARSON	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.	0
1614	CARSON	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?	0
1615	CARSON	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.	0
1616	CARSON	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.	0
1617	QUICK	Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
1618	QUICK	Governor?	0
1619	CHRISTIE	And — and — and I — you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.	0
1620	CHRISTIE	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton — and I've already heard from her — is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.	0
1621	CHRISTIE	What we know is we're living longer.	0
1622	CHRISTIE	That's a blessing.	0
1623	CHRISTIE	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.	0
1624	CHRISTIE	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?	0
1625	CHRISTIE	Or would you rather take less later on?	0
1626	QUINTANILLA	Senator Rubio...	0

1638	RUBIO	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.	0
1639	RUBIO	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."	0
1640	RUBIO	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.	0

1649	RUBIO	The Democrats can't even come up with one.	0
1650	RUBIO	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.	0
1651	RUBIO	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.	0
1652	RUBIO	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.	0
1653	RUBIO	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.	0
1654	RUBIO	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.	0
1655	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
1656	RUBIO	So, we're talking about — we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.	0
1657	RUBIO	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.	0

1673	FIORINA	I would like to start with a basic.	0
1674	FIORINA	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.	0
1675	FIORINA	It's kind of basic.	0
1676	FIORINA	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.	0
1677	FIORINA	My point is this.	0
1678	FIORINA	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.	0
1679	FIORINA	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.	0
1680	FIORINA	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.	0
1681	HARWOOD	We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece.	0
1682	HARWOOD	We're going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.	0
1683	PAUL	Liberty thrives when government is small.	0
1684	PAUL	I want a government so small I can barely see it.	0
1685	PAUL	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.	0
1686	PAUL	I think, though, government is too big now.	0
1687	PAUL	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.	0
1688	PAUL	This is extraordinary.	0
1689	PAUL	It's extraordinarily wrong.	0
1690	PAUL	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.	0

1695	CHRISTIE	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?	0
1696	CHRISTIE	I've got one more question for you then.	0
1697	CHRISTIE	Are you serious about this election?	0

1709	CRUZ	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.	0
1710	CRUZ	The natural next question is who actually has done so.	0
1711	CRUZ	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?	0
1712	CRUZ	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
1713	CRUZ	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
1714	CRUZ	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
1715	CRUZ	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.	0
1716	CRUZ	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.	0

1772	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
1773	HARWOOD	Senator Rubio.	0
1774	RUBIO	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.	0
1775	RUBIO	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.	0
1776	RUBIO	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.	0
1777	RUBIO	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.	0
1778	RUBIO	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.	0
1779	RUBIO	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.	0
1780	RUBIO	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.	0
1781	RUBIO	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.	0
1782	RUBIO	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.	0
1783	RUBIO	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.	0
1784	HARWOOD	Thank you, Senator.	0
1785	HARWOOD	Governor Bush?	0
1786	BUSH	America's at a crossroads.	0
1787	BUSH	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.	0
1788	BUSH	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.	0
1789	BUSH	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.	0
1790	BUSH	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.	0
1791	BUSH	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.	0
1792	BUSH	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.	0
1793	BUSH	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.	0
1794	BUSH	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.	0
1795	HARWOOD	Thank you, Governor.	0
1796	HARWOOD	Governor Huckabee.	0
1797	HUCKABEE	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.	0
1798	HUCKABEE	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.	0
1799	HUCKABEE	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.	0
1800	HUCKABEE	I've got five grandkids.	0
1801	HUCKABEE	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.	0
1802	HUCKABEE	Good luck making something out of this mess."	0
1803	HUCKABEE	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.	0
1804	HUCKABEE	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.	0
1805	HUCKABEE	I know this, I certainly am.	0
1806	HARWOOD	Thank you...	0
1807	HUCKABEE	...Thank you.	0
1808	HARWOOD	Governor Kasich?	0
1809	KASICH	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"	0
1810	KASICH	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.	0
1811	KASICH	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.	0
1812	KASICH	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.	0
1813	KASICH	We need to rebuild our families.	0
1814	KASICH	We need to have stronger families.	0
1815	KASICH	We need to know who our neighbors are.	0
1816	KASICH	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.	0
1817	KASICH	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.	0
1818	KASICH	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.	0
1819	KASICH	And God bless America.	0
