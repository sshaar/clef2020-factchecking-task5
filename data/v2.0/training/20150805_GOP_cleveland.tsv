41	WALLACE	Brett -- Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.	0
42	BAIER	It might be.	0
43	BAIER	It might be.	0
44	BAIER	We'll see.	0
45	BAIER	Is this in the rules?	0
46	BAIER	An objection's coming.	0
47	BAIER	It might be.	0
48	BAIER	The rules for tonight are simple.	0
49	BAIER	One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups.	0
50	BAIER	And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.	0
51	BAIER	Pleasant, no?	0
52	BAIER	We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.	0
53	BAIER	And while we expect them...	0
54	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
55	BAIER	... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate.	0
56	BAIER	So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street.	0
57	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
58	BAIER	Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight.	0
59	BAIER	Without further ado, let's begin.	0
60	BAIER	Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions.	0
61	BAIER	So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one.	0
62	BAIER	Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.	0
63	BAIER	Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.	0
64	BAIER	Mr. Trump.	0
65	SYSTEM	[ booing ]	0
66	BAIER	Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.	0
67	TRUMP	I fully understand.	0
68	BAIER	The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.	0
69	TRUMP	I fully understand.	0
70	BAIER	And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.	0
71	BAIER	You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?	0
72	TRUMP	I cannot say.	0
73	TRUMP	I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do.	0
74	TRUMP	I can totally make that pledge.	0
75	TRUMP	If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent.	0
76	TRUMP	But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.	0
77	TRUMP	We want to win, and we will win.	0
78	TRUMP	But I want to win as the Republican.	0
79	TRUMP	I want to run as the Republican nominee.	0
80	BAIER	So tonight, you can't say if another one of these...	0
81	PAUL	This is what's wrong!	0
82	BAIER	OK.	0
83	PAUL	I mean, this is what's wrong.	0
84	PAUL	He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he's already...	0
85	BAIER	Dr. Paul.	0
86	PAUL	Hey, look, look!	0
87	PAUL	He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?	0
88	PAUL	So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...	0
89	BAIER	OK.	0
90	PAUL	...but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.	0
91	TRUMP	Well, I've given him plenty of money.	0
92	BAIER	Just to be clear, you can't make a -- we're gonna -- we're going to move on.	0
93	BAIER	You're not gonna make the pledge tonight?	0
94	TRUMP	I will not make the pledge at this time.	0
95	BAIER	OK. Alright.	0
96	SYSTEM	[ laughter and boing ]	0
97	KELLY	Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.	0
98	KELLY	You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.	0
99	KELLY	Your critics say that your inexperience shows.	0
100	KELLY	You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.	0
101	KELLY	Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?	0
102	CARSON	Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time.	0
103	CARSON	But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.	0
104	CARSON	So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.	0
105	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: "There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd."	0
106	WALLACE	Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.	0
107	RUBIO	Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight.	0
108	RUBIO	Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.	0
109	RUBIO	I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition.	0
110	RUBIO	It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.	0
111	RUBIO	Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past.	0
112	RUBIO	It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.	0
113	RUBIO	This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed.	0
114	RUBIO	You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store?	0
115	RUBIO	And these changes have been disruptive.	0
116	RUBIO	They have changed people's lives.	0
117	RUBIO	The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.	0
118	RUBIO	If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?	0
119	RUBIO	I was raised paycheck to paycheck.	0
120	RUBIO	How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans?	0
121	RUBIO	I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.	0
122	RUBIO	If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.	0
123	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
124	BAIER	Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man.	0
125	BAIER	You say you have a life experience uniquely your own.	0
126	BAIER	Not your father's, not your brother's.	0
127	BAIER	But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, "the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."	0
128	BAIER	So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?	0
129	BUSH	Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win.	0
130	BUSH	I'm gonna have to earn this.	0
131	BUSH	Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me.	0
132	BUSH	That's fine.	0
133	BUSH	I've got a record in Florida.	0
134	BUSH	I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother.	0
135	BUSH	In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.	0
136	BUSH	I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.	0
137	BUSH	We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget.	0
138	BUSH	We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.	0
139	BUSH	We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.	0
140	BUSH	They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone.	0
141	BUSH	Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget.	0
142	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
143	BUSH	I am my own man.	0
144	BUSH	I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively.	0
145	BUSH	And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created.	0
146	BUSH	We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up.	0
147	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
148	KELLY	Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter.	0
149	KELLY	However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.	0
150	KELLY	You've called women you don't like "fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals."	0
151	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
152	KELLY	Your Twitter account...	0
153	TRUMP	Only Rosie O'Donnell.	0
154	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
155	KELLY	No, it wasn't.	0
156	KELLY	[	0
157	KELLY	applause ] Your Twitter account...	0
158	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
159	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
160	KELLY	For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.	0
161	TRUMP	Yes, I'm sure it was.	0
162	KELLY	Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks.	0
163	KELLY	You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.	0
164	KELLY	Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?	0
165	TRUMP	I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.	0
166	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
167	TRUMP	I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness.	0
168	TRUMP	And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.	0
169	TRUMP	This country is in big trouble.	0
170	TRUMP	We don't win anymore.	0
171	TRUMP	We lose to China.	0
172	TRUMP	We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border.	0
173	TRUMP	We lose to everybody.	0
174	TRUMP	And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding.	0
175	TRUMP	We have a good time.	0
176	TRUMP	What I say is what I say.	0
177	TRUMP	And honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry.	0
178	TRUMP	I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.	0
179	TRUMP	But I wouldn't do that.	0
180	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
181	TRUMP	But you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around.	0
182	TRUMP	That, I can tell you right now.	0
183	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party.	0
184	WALLACE	He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities.	0
185	WALLACE	You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress.	0
186	WALLACE	You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently.	0
187	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
188	WALLACE	How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?	0
189	CRUZ	Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.	0
190	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
191	CRUZ	If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.	0
192	CRUZ	There is a reason...	0
193	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
194	CRUZ	.... that we have $18 trillion in debt.	0
195	CRUZ	Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections.	0
196	CRUZ	We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments.	0
197	CRUZ	I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.	0
198	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
199	BAIER	Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives.	0
200	BAIER	You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state.	0
201	BAIER	On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.	0
202	BAIER	This -- this may be why.	0
203	BAIER	Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades.	0
204	BAIER	The state's 44th in private sector growth.	0
205	BAIER	You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country.	0
206	BAIER	So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?	0
207	CHRISTIE	If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there.	0
208	SYSTEM	[ laught and applause ]	0
209	CHRISTIE	The fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.	0
210	CHRISTIE	In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent.	0
211	CHRISTIE	And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.	0
212	CHRISTIE	In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey.	0
213	CHRISTIE	Zero.	0
214	CHRISTIE	For eight years.	0
215	CHRISTIE	So, what did we do?	0
216	CHRISTIE	We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget.	0
217	CHRISTIE	We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.	0
218	CHRISTIE	In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor.	0
219	CHRISTIE	We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.	0
220	CHRISTIE	And, what's happened since?	0
221	CHRISTIE	A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor.	0
222	CHRISTIE	We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back.	0
223	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
224	KELLY	Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.	0
225	KELLY	You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it.	0
226	KELLY	Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?	0
227	WALKER	Well, I'm pro-life, I've always been pro-life, and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that...	0
228	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
229	WALKER	...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there, and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother.	0
230	WALKER	That's been consistently proven.	0
231	WALKER	Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out...	0
232	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
233	WALKER	...I've got a position that's in line with everyday America.	0
234	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
235	WALLACE	Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues.	0
236	WALLACE	You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.	0
237	WALLACE	You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother.	0
238	WALLACE	Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?	0
239	HUCKABEE	Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment.	0
240	HUCKABEE	That's a long and difficult process.	0
241	HUCKABEE	I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that.	0
242	HUCKABEE	A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer.	0
243	HUCKABEE	I think it's time to do something even more bold.	0
244	HUCKABEE	I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception.	0
245	HUCKABEE	The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on.	0
246	HUCKABEE	And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.	0
247	HUCKABEE	It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick.	0
248	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
249	BAIER	Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.	0
250	BAIER	You later said that that statement, you could have said it better.	0
251	BAIER	But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, "Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years."	0
252	BAIER	Why are you so quick to blame your own party?	0
253	PAUL	First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism.	0
254	PAUL	Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity.	0
255	PAUL	But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?	0
256	PAUL	I've got a proposal.	0
257	PAUL	I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS.	0
258	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
259	PAUL	I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS.	0
260	PAUL	ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees.	0
261	PAUL	It's a disgrace.	0
262	PAUL	We've got to stop -- we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.	0
263	PAUL	So, we didn't create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them.	0

265	KELLY	Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.	0
266	KELLY	You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.	0
267	KELLY	Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?	0
268	KASICH	Well, first of all...	0
269	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
270	KASICH	...	0
271	KASICH	first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.	0
272	KASICH	Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?	0
273	KASICH	To treat the mentally ill.	0
274	KASICH	Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons.	0
275	KASICH	It costs $22,500 a year...	0
276	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
277	KASICH	...	0
278	KASICH	to keep them in prison.	0
279	KASICH	I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.	0
280	KASICH	Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted.	0
281	KASICH	Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems.	0
282	KASICH	We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families.	0
283	KASICH	So we're treating them and getting them on their feet.	0
284	KASICH	And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.	0
285	KASICH	And do you know what?	0
286	KASICH	Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose.	0
287	KASICH	And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.	0
288	KASICH	And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black.	0
289	KASICH	We've cut $5 billion in taxes...	0

293	WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.	0
294	WALLACE	Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue.	0
295	WALLACE	I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants.	0
296	WALLACE	And here's what you said.	0
297	WALLACE	They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love.	0
298	WALLACE	It's an act of commitment to your family.	0
299	WALLACE	Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?	0
300	BUSH	I do.	0
301	BUSH	I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option.	0
302	BUSH	They want to provide for their family.	0
303	BUSH	But we need to control our border.	0
304	BUSH	It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in.	0
305	BUSH	So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay.	0
306	BUSH	We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security.	0
307	BUSH	We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country.	0
308	BUSH	It is ridiculous and tragic...	0
309	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
310	BUSH	...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law.	0
311	BUSH	There's much to do.	0
312	BUSH	And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth.	0
313	BUSH	And there should be a path to earned legal status...	0
314	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]	0
315	BUSH	...	0
316	BUSH	for those that are here.	0
317	BUSH	Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.	0
318	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.	0
319	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
320	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border.	0
321	WALLACE	Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, "extraordinarily ugly."	0
322	WALLACE	I'd like you -- you're right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.	0
323	WALLACE	Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?	0
324	TRUMP	So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.	0
325	TRUMP	You wouldn't even be talking about it.	0
326	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
327	TRUMP	This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement.	0
328	TRUMP	And I said, Mexico is sending.	0
329	TRUMP	Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.	0
330	TRUMP	The fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in.	0
331	TRUMP	And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.	0
332	TRUMP	And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally.	0
333	TRUMP	But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out.	0
334	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]	0
335	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?	0
336	WALLACE	Thirty seconds.	0
337	TRUMP	Border Patrol, I was at the border last week.	0
338	TRUMP	Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening.	0
339	TRUMP	Because our leaders are stupid.	0
340	TRUMP	Our politicians are stupid.	0
341	TRUMP	And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.	0
342	TRUMP	And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them.	0
343	TRUMP	They don't want to take care of them.	0
344	TRUMP	Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?	0
345	TRUMP	And that's what is happening whether you like it or not.	0
346	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]	0
347	WALLACE	All right.	0
348	WALLACE	Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this.	0

356	WALLACE	Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night.	0
357	WALLACE	We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration.	0
358	WALLACE	We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there.	0
359	WALLACE	So let's continue the conversation.	0
360	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump.	0
361	WALLACE	But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said.	0
362	WALLACE	When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?	0
363	KASICH	Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it.	0
364	KASICH	Here is the thing about Donald Trump.	0
365	KASICH	Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country.	0
366	KASICH	He is.	0
367	KASICH	He's hitting a nerve.	0
368	KASICH	People are frustrated.	0
369	KASICH	They're fed up.	0
370	KASICH	They don't think the government is working for them.	0
371	KASICH	And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake.	0
372	KASICH	Now, he's got his solutions.	0
373	KASICH	Some of us have other solutions.	0
374	KASICH	You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington.	0
375	KASICH	Hasn't been done since.	0
376	KASICH	I was a military reformer.	0
377	KASICH	I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.	0
378	WALLACE	Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?	0
379	KASICH	But the point is that we all have solutions.	0
380	KASICH	Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built.	0
381	KASICH	They want to see an end to illegal immigration.	0
382	KASICH	They want to see it, and we all do.	0
383	KASICH	But we all have different ways of getting there.	0
384	KASICH	And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.	0
385	WALLACE	All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you.	0
386	WALLACE	Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?	0
387	RUBIO	Let me set the record straight on a couple of things.	0
388	RUBIO	The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico.	0
389	RUBIO	They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.	0
390	RUBIO	Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.	0
391	RUBIO	I also believe we need a fence.	0
392	RUBIO	The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too.	0
393	RUBIO	And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration.	0
394	RUBIO	But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said.	0
395	RUBIO	People are frustrated.	0
396	RUBIO	This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration.	0
397	RUBIO	There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of.	0
398	RUBIO	We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.	0
399	RUBIO	And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates.	0
400	RUBIO	The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States.	0
401	RUBIO	And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in.	0
402	RUBIO	And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally.	0
403	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
404	RUBIO	And so these are important issues, and we should address it.	0
405	RUBIO	It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.	0
406	WALLACE	Governor Walker.	0
407	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
408	WALLACE	Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.	0
409	WALLACE	Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind.	0
410	WALLACE	Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?	0
411	WALKER	Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year.	0
412	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
413	WALKER	I acknowledged that.	0
414	WALKER	I said I actually listened to the American people.	0
415	WALKER	And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them.	0
416	WALKER	I talked to border state governors and other elected officials.	0
417	WALKER	I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country.	0
418	WALKER	Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.	0
419	WALKER	I believe we need to secure the border.	0
420	WALKER	I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there.	0
421	WALKER	There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it.	0
422	WALKER	Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.	0
423	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
424	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal.	0
425	WALLACE	Doug Bettencourt sent this question, "will you support Kate Steinle's Law," which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country?	0
426	WALLACE	And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?	0
427	CRUZ	Chris, absolutely yes.	0
428	CRUZ	And not only will I support it...	0
429	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
430	CRUZ	...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation.	0
431	CRUZ	I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.	0
432	CRUZ	You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid.	0
433	CRUZ	It's not a question of stupidity.	0
434	CRUZ	It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws.	0
435	CRUZ	That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.	0
436	CRUZ	President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country.	0
437	CRUZ	There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country.	0
438	CRUZ	If they come legally, great.	0
439	CRUZ	But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.	0
440	CRUZ	A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty.	0
441	CRUZ	I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.	0
442	KELLY	Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.	0
443	KELLY	Governor Christie.	0
444	KELLY	You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.	0
445	KELLY	Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?	0
446	CHRISTIE	Yes, I do.	0
447	CHRISTIE	And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.	0
448	CHRISTIE	I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.	0
449	CHRISTIE	This is not theoretical to me.	0
450	CHRISTIE	I went to the funerals.	0
451	CHRISTIE	We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day.	0
452	CHRISTIE	My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.	0
453	CHRISTIE	When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.	0
454	CHRISTIE	And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.	0
455	CHRISTIE	We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way.	0
456	CHRISTIE	As president, that is exactly what I'll do.	0
457	PAUL	Megyn, may I respond?	0
458	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
459	PAUL	May I respond?	0
460	KELLY	Go ahead, sir.	0
461	PAUL	I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans.	0
462	PAUL	The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over!	0
463	PAUL	John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.	0
464	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
465	CHRISTIE	And -- and, Megyn?	0
466	CHRISTIE	Megyn, that's a -- that, you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer.	0
467	CHRISTIE	I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.	0
468	CHRISTIE	How are you supposed to know, Megyn?	0
469	PAUL	Use the Fourth Amendment!	0
470	CHRISTIE	What are you supposed to...	0
471	PAUL	Use the Fourth Amendment!	0
472	CHRISTIE	...how are you supposed to -- no, I'll tell you how you, look...	0
473	PAUL	Get a warrant!	0
474	CHRISTIE	Let me tell you something, you go...	0
475	PAUL	Get a judge to sign the warrant!	0

478	KELLY	Governor Christie, make your point.	0
479	CHRISTIE	Listen, senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.	0
480	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
481	CHRISTIE	When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...	0
482	PAUL	See, here's the problem.	0
483	CHRISTIE	...is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work.	0
484	PAUL	Here's the problem, governor.	0
485	PAUL	Here's the problem, governor.	0
486	PAUL	You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.	0
487	PAUL	Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge.	0
488	PAUL	I'm talking about searches without warrants...	0
489	CHRISTIE	There is no...	0
490	PAUL	...indiscriminately, of all Americans' records, and that's what I fought to end.	0
491	PAUL	I don't trust President Obama with our records.	0
492	PAUL	I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.	0

494	KELLY	Go ahead, governor.	0
495	CHRISTIE	And you know -- you know, Senator Paul?	0
496	CHRISTIE	Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.	0
497	CHRISTIE	Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...	0
498	KELLY	Alright.	0
499	CHRISTIE	...and while still putting our country at risk.	0

504	CHRISTIE	You know what, Megyn, can I...	0
505	KELLY	Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we're gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner.	0
506	KELLY	His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:	0
507	SYSTEM	[ video clip begins ]	0
508	QUESTION	: My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS -- ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president?	0
509	SYSTEM	[ video clip ends ]	0
510	KELLY	Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.	0
511	KELLY	You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: "What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?"	0
512	KELLY	He told you "IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide."	0
513	KELLY	And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.	0
514	KELLY	How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?	0
515	CRUZ	Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth.	0
516	CRUZ	We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism".	0
517	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
518	CRUZ	When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution.	0
519	CRUZ	We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization.	0
520	CRUZ	That, with all due respect, is nonsense.	0
521	CRUZ	It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs.	0
522	CRUZ	What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.	0
523	KELLY	You don't see it as...	0
524	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
525	KELLY	...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one?	0
526	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
527	CRUZ	Megyn, of course it's an ideological problem, that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans.	0
528	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
529	CRUZ	Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist.	0
530	CRUZ	He said, "Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--"	0
531	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]	0
532	CRUZ	We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.	0
533	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
534	KELLY	Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...	0
535	BUSH	...I remember...	0
536	KELLY	...we would've invaded Iraq...	0
537	BUSH	...I remember, Megyn.	0
538	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
539	KELLY	I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.	0
540	KELLY	You finally said, "No."	0
541	KELLY	To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?	0
542	BUSH	Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake.	0
543	BUSH	I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them.	0
544	BUSH	Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.	0
545	BUSH	And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.	0
546	BUSH	So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that.	0
547	BUSH	Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject.	0
548	BUSH	Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq.	0
549	BUSH	He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for.	0
550	BUSH	ISIS was created because	0
551	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]	0
552	BUSH	of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.	0
553	BUSH	To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.	0
554	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
555	KELLY	Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world.	0
556	KELLY	Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?	0
557	WALKER	I don't know about additional ones.	0
558	WALKER	We need to focus on the ones we have.	0
559	WALKER	You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.	0
560	WALKER	You look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today?	0
561	WALKER	Set aside the Iran deal.	0
562	WALKER	They said it's the disengagement of America.	0
563	WALKER	We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America's a great country.	0
564	WALKER	We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.	0
565	KELLY	Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror.	0
566	KELLY	As president, would you bring back water boarding?	0

583	CARSON	And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people.	0
584	CARSON	And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.	0

593	TRUMP	Correct.	0
594	BAIER	Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care.	0
595	BAIER	You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.	1
596	BAIER	Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?	0
597	TRUMP	First of all, I'd like to just go back to one.	0
598	TRUMP	In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
599	TRUMP	And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it.	0
600	TRUMP	And that's exactly what happened.	0
601	BAIER	But on ObamaCare...	0
602	TRUMP	And the Middle East became totally destabilized.	0
603	TRUMP	So I just want to say.	0
604	TRUMP	As far as single payer, it works in Canada.	0
605	TRUMP	It works incredibly well in Scotland.	0
606	TRUMP	It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.	0
607	TRUMP	What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state.	0
608	TRUMP	I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees.	0
609	TRUMP	And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder.	0
610	TRUMP	Nobody can bid.	0
611	TRUMP	You know why?	0
612	TRUMP	Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.	0

699	BAIER	But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.	0
700	BAIER	In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.	0

702	HUCKABEE	It's not too big to shrink.	0

717	CARSON	And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.	0
718	CARSON	And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made.	0
719	CARSON	If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes.	0
720	CARSON	And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes.	0

731	BAIER	Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math.	0
732	BAIER	A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education.	0
733	BAIER	They say it should all be handled locally.	0
734	BAIER	President Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, "fringe group of critics."	0
735	BAIER	Do you think that's accurate?	0
736	BUSH	No, I don't.	0
737	BUSH	And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content.	0
738	BUSH	It is clearly a state responsibility.	0
739	BUSH	I'm for higher standards...	0
740	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
741	BUSH	...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion.	0
742	BUSH	And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.	0
743	BUSH	And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.	0
744	BUSH	And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country.	0
745	BUSH	Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent.	0
746	BUSH	That's what I'm for.	0
747	BAIER	Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?	0
748	RUBIO	Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform.	0
749	RUBIO	It is critically important in the 21st Century.	0
750	RUBIO	We do need curriculum reform.	0

754	RUBIO	that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.	0
755	RUBIO	Here's the problem with Common Core.	0
756	RUBIO	The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied.	0
757	RUBIO	They will not stop with it being a suggestion.	0

807	KASICH	But I think she will come in a narrow way.	0
808	KASICH	The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth.	0
809	KASICH	Which is balancing budgets.	0
810	KASICH	You know, we were talking about it.	0
811	KASICH	People were saying, could we do it?	0
812	KASICH	I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.	0
813	KASICH	Economic growth is the key.	0
814	KASICH	Economic growth is the key to everything.	0

869	WALLACE	Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?	0

886	CHRISTIE	I mean, so, there's a difference -- I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%.	0
887	CHRISTIE	And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.	0
888	CHRISTIE	Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security.	0
889	CHRISTIE	Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives.	0
890	CHRISTIE	Secondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved.	0
891	CHRISTIE	They don't need that Social Security check.	0
892	CHRISTIE	Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.	0

896	WALLACE	You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption.	0
897	WALLACE	Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?	0
898	HUCKABEE	Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million.	0
899	HUCKABEE	A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security.	0
900	HUCKABEE	Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.	0
901	HUCKABEE	The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not.	0
902	HUCKABEE	And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.	0
903	HUCKABEE	Now, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up?	0
904	HUCKABEE	Is it the recipients, or is it the government?	0
905	HUCKABEE	And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.	0
906	HUCKABEE	It's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it.	0

927	HUCKABEE	Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.	0
928	HUCKABEE	The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people	0

941	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records.	0
942	WALLACE	From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.	0
943	UNKNOWN	...In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: "I've used the laws of the country to my advantage."	0
944	UNKNOWN	But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.	0
945	UNKNOWN	Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?	0
946	TRUMP	Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.	0
947	TRUMP	I have never gone bankrupt, by the way.	0

951	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
952	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
953	WALLACE	... that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.	0
954	TRUMP	Excuse me, what am I saying?	0
955	TRUMP	Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people.	0
956	TRUMP	I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.	0
957	TRUMP	The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it.	0
958	TRUMP	When I use it, they say, "Trump, Trump, Trump."	0
959	TRUMP	The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.	0
960	TRUMP	I have a great, great company.	0

998	RUBIO	That's a great question.	0
999	WALLACE	Senator, how do you answer Tania?	0
1000	RUBIO	That's a great question.	0
1001	RUBIO	First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago.	0
1002	RUBIO	It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.	0
1003	RUBIO	Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.	0
1004	RUBIO	The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.	0
1005	RUBIO	We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy.	0
1006	RUBIO	We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.	0
1007	RUBIO	And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank.	0
1008	RUBIO	It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.	0

1031	BAIER	You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one.	0
1032	BAIER	If this deal is undone, what then?	0
1033	WALKER	Well, first off, let's remember.	0
1034	WALKER	I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage.	0
1035	WALKER	Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.	0
1036	WALKER	To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.	0
1037	WALKER	This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS.	0
1038	WALKER	It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it.	0
1039	WALKER	It's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.	0

1042	PAUL	I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it.	0
1043	PAUL	I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don't immediately discount negotiations.	0
1044	PAUL	I'm a Reagan conservative.	0
1045	PAUL	Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets.	0
1046	PAUL	But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.	0
1047	PAUL	If there's going to be a negotiation, you're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply.	0
1048	PAUL	And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said "do you believe they're trustworthy?"	0
1049	PAUL	and he said "No."	0
1050	PAUL	And I said, "well, how are we gonna get them to comply?"	0
1051	PAUL	I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.	0
1052	BAIER	Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?	0
1053	HUCKABEE	Ronald Reagan said "trust, but verify."	0
1054	HUCKABEE	President Obama is "trust, but vilify."	0
1055	HUCKABEE	He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.	0

1188	KELLY	And if not, why not?	0
1189	WALKER	Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training.	0
1190	WALKER	It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force.	0
1191	WALKER	And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement.	0
1192	WALKER	And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.	0
1193	KELLY	Thank you.	0

1198	BAIER	Our next topic is foreign policy.	0
1199	BAIER	Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	0
1200	BAIER	His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop's deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan.	0
1201	BAIER	His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.	0
1202	BAIER	So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?	0
1203	TRUMP	I would be so different from what you have right now.	0
1204	TRUMP	Like, the polar opposite.	0
1205	TRUMP	We have a president who doesn't have a clue.	0
1206	TRUMP	I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice.	0
1207	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
1208	TRUMP	But if you look at the deals we make, whether it's the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system.	0
1209	TRUMP	You look at Sgt.	0
1210	TRUMP	Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want.	0
1211	TRUMP	We have people in Washington that don't know what they're doing.	0
1212	TRUMP	Now...	0

1224	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	...Please.	0
1225	BAIER	...email.	0
1226	BAIER	This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.	0
1227	BAIER	Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?	0
1228	CRUZ	Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.	0
1229	CRUZ	Leading from behind is a disaster.	0
1230	CRUZ	We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger.	0
1231	CRUZ	Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.	0
1232	CRUZ	He's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani.	0
1233	CRUZ	The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs.	0
1234	CRUZ	We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility...	0

1236	CRUZ	It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.	0

1238	BAIER	Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, "that's a redline for us," and that there would be enormous consequences.	0
1239	BAIER	One year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.	0
1240	BAIER	As president, would you have used military force there?	0
1241	CARSON	Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies.	0
1242	CARSON	Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940.	0
1243	CARSON	In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel.	0
1244	CARSON	Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.	0
1245	CARSON	Our -- our friends can't trust us anymore.	0
1246	CARSON	You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state.	0
1247	CARSON	They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them.	0
1248	CARSON	We won't even give them offensive weapons.	0
1249	CARSON	You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally.	0
1250	CARSON	You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything.	0
1251	CARSON	I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work.	0

1253	BAIER	Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?	0
1254	WALKER	Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress.	0
1255	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]	0
1256	WALKER	And -- and that has put our national security at risk.	0
1257	WALKER	If I am president, he won't think about that.	0
1258	WALKER	You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets.	0
1259	WALKER	When you find mush, you push.	0
1260	WALKER	When you find steel, you stop.	0
1261	WALKER	Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years.	0
1262	WALKER	We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies.	0
1263	WALKER	I would send weapons to Ukraine.	0
1264	WALKER	I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic.	0

1268	BAIER	Women are moving into combat roles.	0
1269	BAIER	Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped.	0
1270	BAIER	And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.	0
1271	BAIER	As commander in chief, how would you handle that?	0
1272	HUCKABEE	The military is not a social experiment.	0
1273	HUCKABEE	The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.	0
1274	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1275	HUCKABEE	It's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse.	0
1276	HUCKABEE	The purpose is to protect America.	0
1277	HUCKABEE	I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.	0
1278	HUCKABEE	We've reduced the military by 25 percent...	0
1279	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1280	HUCKABEE	... under President Obama.	0
1281	HUCKABEE	The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military.	0
1282	HUCKABEE	The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.	0
1283	HUCKABEE	We've not done that because we've decimated our military.	0
1284	HUCKABEE	We're flying B-52s.	0
1285	HUCKABEE	The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962.	0
1286	HUCKABEE	A lot of the B-52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me.	0

1289	BAIER	Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel.	0
1290	BAIER	You have since changed your view on that issue.	0
1291	BAIER	What made you change your mind.	0
1292	PAUL	Well, let's be clear, I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances.	0
1293	PAUL	I've put pencil to paper...	0
1294	UNKNOWN	I do.	0
1295	PAUL	... and I've said -- and I've said I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where.	0
1296	PAUL	Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us.	0
1297	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1298	PAUL	I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag.	0
1299	PAUL	Israel is not one of those.	0
1300	PAUL	But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent.	0
1301	PAUL	My position is exactly the same.	0
1302	PAUL	We shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.	0
1303	BAIER	OK.	0
1304	BAIER	But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?	0
1305	PAUL	I still say exactly what my original opinion is.	0
1306	PAUL	Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone?	0
1307	PAUL	Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally.	0
1308	PAUL	And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don't have.	0
1309	PAUL	We do not project power from bankruptcy court.	0
1310	PAUL	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.	0

1313	BAIER	Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?	0
1314	CHRISTIE	Well, listen.	0
1315	CHRISTIE	You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.	0
1316	CHRISTIE	I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier.	0
1317	CHRISTIE	The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army.	0
1318	CHRISTIE	No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps.	0
1319	CHRISTIE	Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.	0
1320	CHRISTIE	Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world.	0
1321	CHRISTIE	Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better.	0
1322	CHRISTIE	Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing.	0
1323	CHRISTIE	And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies.	0
1324	CHRISTIE	But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.	0

1336	KELLY	Senator Cruz, start from you.	0
1337	KELLY	Any word from God?	0

1343	CRUZ	And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.	0
1344	CRUZ	And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church.	0

1349	CRUZ	We see lots of "campaign conservatives."	0
1350	CRUZ	But if we're going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.	0
1351	CRUZ	There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage.	0
1352	CRUZ	And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.	0

1369	KASICH	You know, today the country is divided.	0
1370	KASICH	You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities.	0
1371	KASICH	We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.	0
1372	KASICH	And we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us.	0
1373	KASICH	But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.	0
1374	KASICH	He wants America to succeed.	0

1381	WALKER	And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins.	0
1382	WALKER	So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.	0
1383	WALKER	What God calls us to do is follow his will.	0
1384	WALKER	And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do.	0
1385	WALKER	And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.	0
1386	WALKER	It wasn't just how I took on those political battles.	0

1407	RUBIO	Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them.	0
1408	RUBIO	I am proud that last year we helped change the law.	0
1409	RUBIO	We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.	0
1410	RUBIO	And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date.	0

1478	BAIER	Senator Marco Rubio.	0
1479	RUBIO	Thank you.	0
1480	RUBIO	You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba.	0
1481	RUBIO	They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance.	0
1482	RUBIO	Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.	0
1483	RUBIO	My father was a bartender.	0
1484	RUBIO	And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream.	0
1485	RUBIO	It is what makes our nation different.	0
1486	RUBIO	And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now.	0
1487	RUBIO	I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.	0

1508	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
1509	CARSON	But I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day.	0
1510	CARSON	Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation.	0
1511	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1512	BAIER	Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.	0
1513	HUCKABEE	It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who's very high in the polls, that doesn't have a clue about how to govern.	0
1514	HUCKABEE	A person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.	0
1515	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0

1534	BUSH	Here's what I believe.	0
1535	BUSH	I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world.	0
1536	BUSH	But Washington is holding us back.	0
1537	BUSH	How we tax, how we regulate.	0
1538	BUSH	We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.	0
1539	BUSH	We're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation.	0
1540	BUSH	All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues.	0
