1	WALLACE	Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
2	WALLACE	I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.	0
3	WALLACE	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
4	WALLACE	The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.	0
5	WALLACE	Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.	0
6	WALLACE	For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.	0
7	WALLACE	None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.	0
8	WALLACE	The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.	0
9	WALLACE	No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.	0
10	WALLACE	No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.	0
11	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
12	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.	0
13	WALLACE	Let's get right to it.	0
14	WALLACE	The first topic is the Supreme Court.	0
15	WALLACE	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.	0
16	WALLACE	Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.	0
17	WALLACE	First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?	0
18	WALLACE	And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?	0
19	WALLACE	Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?	0
20	WALLACE	In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.	0
21	WALLACE	You have two minutes.	0
22	CLINTON	Thank you very much, Chris.	0
23	CLINTON	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0
24	CLINTON	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
25	CLINTON	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0
26	CLINTON	What kind of rights will Americans have?	0
27	CLINTON	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0
28	CLINTON	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	0
29	CLINTON	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	1
30	CLINTON	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	1
31	CLINTON	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0
32	CLINTON	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0
33	CLINTON	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0
34	CLINTON	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0
35	CLINTON	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0
36	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
37	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.	0
38	WALLACE	Where do you want to see the court take the country?	0
39	WALLACE	And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?	0
40	TRUMP	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0
41	TRUMP	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0
42	TRUMP	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0
43	TRUMP	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	0
44	TRUMP	And she was forced to apologize.	0
45	TRUMP	And apologize she did.	0
46	TRUMP	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	0
47	TRUMP	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0
48	TRUMP	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	1
49	TRUMP	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0
50	TRUMP	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	0
51	TRUMP	They will have a conservative bent.	0
52	TRUMP	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0
53	TRUMP	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0
54	TRUMP	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0
55	TRUMP	And I believe that's very, very important.	0
56	TRUMP	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	0
57	TRUMP	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0
58	TRUMP	And those are the people that I will appoint.	0
59	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
60	WALLACE	We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.	0
61	WALLACE	I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.	0
62	WALLACE	First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.	0
63	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."	0
64	WALLACE	And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.	0
65	WALLACE	Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.	0
66	WALLACE	What's wrong with that?	0
67	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0
68	CLINTON	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	0
69	CLINTON	I represented upstate New York.	0
70	CLINTON	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0
71	CLINTON	It goes back to the founding of our country.	0
72	CLINTON	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
73	CLINTON	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	0
74	CLINTON	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	1
75	CLINTON	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	0
76	CLINTON	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
77	CLINTON	You mentioned the Heller decision.	0
78	CLINTON	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
79	CLINTON	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	0
80	CLINTON	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0
81	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.	0
82	WALLACE	The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.	0
83	WALLACE	How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?	0
84	WALLACE	You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.	0
85	WALLACE	Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?	0
86	TRUMP	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	0
87	TRUMP	I watched.	0
88	TRUMP	I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.	0
89	TRUMP	And Justice Scalia was so involved.	0
90	TRUMP	And it was a well-crafted decision.	0
91	TRUMP	But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.	0
92	TRUMP	And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.	0
93	WALLACE	Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.	0
94	WALLACE	Were you extremely upset?	0
95	CLINTON	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	0
96	CLINTON	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0
97	CLINTON	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0
98	CLINTON	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	0
99	CLINTON	The gun lobby's on his side.	0
100	CLINTON	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	0
101	CLINTON	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0
102	CLINTON	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	0
103	WALLACE	Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.	0
104	WALLACE	You support a national right to carry law.	0
105	WALLACE	Why, sir?	0
106	TRUMP	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0
107	TRUMP	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	0
108	TRUMP	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	0
109	TRUMP	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	0
110	TRUMP	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
111	TRUMP	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	0
112	TRUMP	So I'm very honored by all of that.	0
113	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0
114	TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0
115	WALLACE	Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.	0
116	TRUMP	Right.	0
117	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.	0
118	WALLACE	But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?	0
119	TRUMP	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0
120	WALLACE	But I'm asking you specifically.	0
121	WALLACE	Would you like to...	0
122	TRUMP	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	0
123	WALLACE	But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.	0
124	WALLACE	Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?	0
125	TRUMP	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0
126	TRUMP	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	0
127	TRUMP	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0
128	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
129	CLINTON	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	0
130	CLINTON	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
131	CLINTON	It is about what's happening right now in America.	0
132	CLINTON	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	0
133	CLINTON	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	0
134	CLINTON	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	0
135	CLINTON	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	0
136	CLINTON	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0
137	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton…	0
138	CLINTON	And we have come too far to have that turned back now.	0
139	WALLACE	And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.	1
140	WALLACE	And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.	0
141	WALLACE	I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.	0
142	WALLACE	You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.	0
143	WALLACE	You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.	0
144	WALLACE	Why?	0
145	CLINTON	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	0
146	CLINTON	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	0
147	CLINTON	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	0
148	CLINTON	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	0
149	CLINTON	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0
150	CLINTON	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0
151	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your reaction?	0
152	WALLACE	And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.	0
153	TRUMP	Well, I think it's terrible.	0
154	TRUMP	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	0
155	TRUMP	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0
156	TRUMP	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	0
157	TRUMP	And that's not acceptable.	0
158	CLINTON	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0
159	CLINTON	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	0
160	CLINTON	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0
161	CLINTON	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
162	CLINTON	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	0
163	CLINTON	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	0
164	CLINTON	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	0
165	CLINTON	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0
166	CLINTON	And I will stand up for that right.	0
167	WALLACE	All right.	0
168	WALLACE	But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...	0
169	TRUMP	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0
170	TRUMP	Nobody has that.	0
171	WALLACE	All right.	0
172	WALLACE	Let's move on to the subject of immigration.	0
173	WALLACE	And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.	0
174	WALLACE	Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.	0
175	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.	0
176	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.	0
177	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.	0
178	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.	0
179	WALLACE	The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?	0
180	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.	0
181	WALLACE	You have two minutes.	0
182	TRUMP	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	0
183	TRUMP	We need strong borders.	0
184	TRUMP	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	0
185	TRUMP	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	0
186	TRUMP	They're coming in illegally.	0
187	TRUMP	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	0
188	TRUMP	We have no country if we have no border.	0
189	TRUMP	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	1
190	TRUMP	She wants to have open borders.	1
191	TRUMP	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	0
192	TRUMP	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	0
193	TRUMP	It means their job is tougher.	0
194	TRUMP	But they know what's going on.	0
195	TRUMP	They know it better than anybody.	0
196	TRUMP	They want strong borders.	0
197	TRUMP	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
198	TRUMP	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	0
199	TRUMP	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	0
200	TRUMP	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	1
201	TRUMP	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	1
202	TRUMP	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	0
203	TRUMP	We have to have strong borders.	0
204	TRUMP	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	0
205	TRUMP	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0
206	TRUMP	We need strong borders.	0
207	TRUMP	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
208	TRUMP	Now, I want to build the wall.	0
209	TRUMP	We need the wall.	0
210	TRUMP	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	0
211	TRUMP	We stop the drugs.	0
212	TRUMP	We shore up the border.	0
213	TRUMP	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	0
214	TRUMP	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0
215	TRUMP	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0
216	TRUMP	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	0
217	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
218	WALLACE	Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.	0
219	WALLACE	Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?	0
220	CLINTON	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	0
221	CLINTON	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0
222	CLINTON	And you're right.	0
223	CLINTON	I don't want to rip families apart.	0
224	CLINTON	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
225	CLINTON	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	0
226	CLINTON	We have 11 million undocumented people.	0
227	CLINTON	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	0
228	CLINTON	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	1
229	CLINTON	Now, here's what that means.	0
230	CLINTON	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	0
231	CLINTON	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0
232	CLINTON	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0
233	CLINTON	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
234	CLINTON	I have been for border security for years.	0
235	CLINTON	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	0
236	CLINTON	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	0
237	CLINTON	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	0
238	CLINTON	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	0
239	CLINTON	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	0
240	CLINTON	Didn't even raise it.	0
241	CLINTON	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	0
242	CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	0
243	CLINTON	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0
244	WALLACE	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
245	WALLACE	I want to follow up...	0
246	TRUMP	Chris, I think it's...	0
247	WALLACE	OK.	0
248	TRUMP	I think I should respond to that.	0
249	TRUMP	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	0
250	TRUMP	Very nice man.	0
251	TRUMP	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0
252	TRUMP	Believe me.	0
253	TRUMP	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	0
254	TRUMP	It's a disaster.	0
255	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
256	TRUMP	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	1
257	TRUMP	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0
258	TRUMP	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	0
259	WALLACE	Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...	0
260	TRUMP	We are a country of laws.	0
261	TRUMP	We either have -- and by the way...	0
262	WALLACE	Now, wait.	0
263	WALLACE	I'd like to hear from...	0
264	TRUMP	Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0
265	WALLACE	I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.	0
266	CLINTON	I voted for border security, and there are...	0
267	TRUMP	And the wall.	0
268	CLINTON	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0
269	CLINTON	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0
270	CLINTON	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	0
271	CLINTON	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	0
272	CLINTON	And Donald knows a lot about this.	0
273	CLINTON	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	1
274	CLINTON	He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported."	0
275	CLINTON	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	0
276	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?	0
277	TRUMP	President Obama has moved millions of people out.	0
278	TRUMP	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	0
279	TRUMP	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	0
280	TRUMP	They've been deported.	0
281	TRUMP	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	0
282	TRUMP	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0
283	TRUMP	We're a country of laws.	0
284	TRUMP	We either have a border or we don't.	0
285	TRUMP	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0
286	TRUMP	But it's very unfair.	0
287	TRUMP	We have millions of people that did it the right way.	0
288	TRUMP	They're on line.	0
289	TRUMP	They're waiting.	0
290	TRUMP	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	0
291	TRUMP	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	0
292	TRUMP	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	0
293	TRUMP	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	0
294	WALLACE	I want to...	0
295	TRUMP	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	0
296	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to...	0
297	CLINTON	We will not have open borders.	0
298	CLINTON	That is...	0
299	WALLACE	Well, let me -- Secretary...	0
300	CLINTON	That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
301	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...	0
302	CLINTON	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0
303	CLINTON	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	0
304	CLINTON	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	0
305	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, excuse me.	0
306	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton.	0
307	CLINTON	to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	0
308	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.	0
309	WALLACE	My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.	0
310	WALLACE	So that's the question...	0
311	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
312	WALLACE	That's the question.	0
313	WALLACE	Please quiet, everybody.	0
314	WALLACE	Is that your dream, open borders?	0
315	CLINTON	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	0
316	CLINTON	You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.	0
317	CLINTON	And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.	0
318	CLINTON	I think that would be a great benefit to us.	0
319	CLINTON	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.	0
320	CLINTON	And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.	0
321	CLINTON	They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.	0
322	CLINTON	Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.	0
323	CLINTON	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.	0
324	CLINTON	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	0
325	CLINTON	Those are the questions we need answered.	0
326	CLINTON	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	0
327	WALLACE	Well?	0
328	TRUMP	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	0
329	TRUMP	How did we get on to Putin?	0
330	WALLACE	Hold on -- hold on, wait.	0
331	WALLACE	Hold on, folks.	0
332	WALLACE	Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.	0
333	WALLACE	Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.	0
334	TRUMP	So just to finish on the borders...	0
335	WALLACE	Yes?	0
336	TRUMP	She wants open borders.	0
337	TRUMP	People are going to pour into our country.	0
338	TRUMP	People are going to come in from Syria.	0
339	TRUMP	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	1
340	TRUMP	They have no idea where they come from.	0
341	TRUMP	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	0
342	TRUMP	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	0
343	TRUMP	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	0
344	TRUMP	Now we can talk about Putin.	0
345	TRUMP	I don't know Putin.	1
346	TRUMP	He said nice things about me.	0
347	TRUMP	If we got along well, that would be good.	0
348	TRUMP	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0
349	TRUMP	He has no respect for her.	0
350	TRUMP	He has no respect for our president.	0
351	TRUMP	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	0
352	TRUMP	And she's playing chicken.	0
353	TRUMP	Look, Putin...	0
354	WALLACE	Wait, but...	0
355	TRUMP	from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0
356	CLINTON	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0
357	TRUMP	No puppet.	0
358	TRUMP	No puppet.	0
359	CLINTON	And it's pretty clear...	0
360	TRUMP	You're the puppet!	0
361	CLINTON	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	0
362	TRUMP	No, you're the puppet.	0
363	CLINTON	that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.	1
364	CLINTON	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	0
365	CLINTON	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.	0
366	CLINTON	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	1
367	CLINTON	I find that deeply disturbing.	0
368	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...	0
369	CLINTON	And I think it's time you take a stand...	0
370	TRUMP	She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.	0
371	CLINTON	I am not quoting myself.	0
372	TRUMP	She has no idea.	0
373	CLINTON	I am quoting 17...	0
374	TRUMP	Hillary, you have no idea.	0
375	CLINTON	17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...	0
376	TRUMP	And our country has no idea.	0
377	CLINTON	agencies.	0
378	TRUMP	Yeah, I doubt it.	0
379	TRUMP	I doubt it.	0
380	CLINTON	Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.	0
381	CLINTON	I find that just absolutely...	0
382	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
383	TRUMP	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	0
384	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...	0
385	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
386	TRUMP	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.	0
387	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...	0
388	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
389	TRUMP	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	0
390	WALLACE	I do get to ask some questions.	0
391	TRUMP	Yes, that's fine.	0
392	WALLACE	And I would like to ask you this direct question.	0
393	WALLACE	The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.	0
394	WALLACE	Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?	0
395	TRUMP	By Russia or anybody else.	0
396	WALLACE	You condemn their interference?	0
397	TRUMP	Of course I condemn.	0
398	TRUMP	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.	0
399	TRUMP	I have no idea.	0
400	WALLACE	I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?	0
401	TRUMP	I never met Putin.	0
402	TRUMP	This is not my best friend.	0
403	TRUMP	But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.	0
404	TRUMP	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	0
405	TRUMP	Whether it's Syria, you name it.	0
406	TRUMP	Missiles.	0
407	TRUMP	Take a look at the "start up" that they signed.	0
408	TRUMP	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	0
409	TRUMP	They create warheads, and we can't.	0
410	TRUMP	The Russians can't believe it.	0
411	TRUMP	She has been outsmarted by Putin.	0
412	TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.	0
413	TRUMP	They've taken over.	0
414	TRUMP	We've spent $6 trillion.	0
415	TRUMP	They've taken over the Middle East.	0
416	TRUMP	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	0
417	WALLACE	We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.	0
418	WALLACE	You got about 45 seconds.	0
419	TRUMP	And she always will be.	0
420	CLINTON	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	0
421	CLINTON	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	0
422	CLINTON	He's...	0
423	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
424	CLINTON	advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
425	CLINTON	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	0
426	CLINTON	But here's the deal.	0
427	CLINTON	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0
428	CLINTON	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	0
429	CLINTON	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	0
430	TRUMP	I have 200 generals...	0
431	WALLACE	Very quickly.	0
432	TRUMP	and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.	0
433	TRUMP	As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.	0
434	TRUMP	We are spending a fortune doing it.	0
435	TRUMP	They have the bargain of the century.	0
436	TRUMP	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	0
437	TRUMP	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	0
438	WALLACE	OK.	0
439	TRUMP	Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.	0
440	TRUMP	This is just another lie.	0
441	CLINTON	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	0
442	TRUMP	There's no quote.	0
443	TRUMP	You're not going to find a quote from me.	0
444	CLINTON	about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.	0
445	CLINTON	That kind...	0
446	TRUMP	And defend yourselves.	0
447	CLINTON	of language -- well...	0
448	TRUMP	And defend yourselves.	0
449	TRUMP	I didn't say nuclear.	0
450	TRUMP	And defend yourself.	0
451	CLINTON	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	0
452	CLINTON	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.	0
453	CLINTON	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
454	CLINTON	I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	0
455	CLINTON	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	0
456	WALLACE	We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.	0
457	WALLACE	And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.	0
458	WALLACE	You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.	0
459	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.	0
460	WALLACE	You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.	0
461	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.	0
462	TRUMP	Yes.	0
463	WALLACE	We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.	0
464	WALLACE	But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.	0
465	WALLACE	In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.	0
466	CLINTON	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0
467	CLINTON	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	0
468	CLINTON	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	1
469	CLINTON	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0
470	CLINTON	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0
471	CLINTON	I want us to do more to help small business.	0
472	CLINTON	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0
473	CLINTON	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	0
474	CLINTON	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
475	CLINTON	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0
476	CLINTON	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0
477	CLINTON	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	0
478	CLINTON	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0
479	CLINTON	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	0
480	CLINTON	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0
481	CLINTON	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0
482	CLINTON	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	0
483	CLINTON	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	0
484	CLINTON	Why?	0
485	CLINTON	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	1
486	CLINTON	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0
487	CLINTON	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0
488	WALLACE	Secretary, thank you.	0
489	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?	0
490	TRUMP	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	1
491	TRUMP	Her tax plan is a disaster.	0
492	TRUMP	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	0
493	TRUMP	And I'm a big proponent.	0
494	TRUMP	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0
495	TRUMP	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	0
496	TRUMP	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	0
497	TRUMP	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	0
498	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
499	TRUMP	We protect Saudi Arabia.	0
500	TRUMP	Why aren't they paying?	0
501	TRUMP	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.	0
502	TRUMP	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	0
503	TRUMP	Because they weren't paying.	0
504	TRUMP	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	0
505	TRUMP	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	0
506	TRUMP	All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.	0
507	TRUMP	They have to pay up.	0
508	TRUMP	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	0
509	TRUMP	And I'm a big fan of NATO.	0
510	TRUMP	But they have to pay up.	0
511	TRUMP	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	0
512	TRUMP	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0
513	TRUMP	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
514	TRUMP	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	0
515	TRUMP	We're up to $20 trillion.	0
516	TRUMP	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.	0
517	TRUMP	We're going to have a lot of free trade.	0
518	TRUMP	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0
519	TRUMP	But we have horrible deals.	0
520	TRUMP	Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.	0
521	TRUMP	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.	0
522	TRUMP	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.	0
523	TRUMP	You go upstate New York.	0
524	TRUMP	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	0
525	TRUMP	We're bringing our jobs back.	0
526	TRUMP	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.	0
527	TRUMP	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.	0
528	TRUMP	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	0
529	TRUMP	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.	0
530	TRUMP	We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
531	TRUMP	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	0
532	TRUMP	They're going to start hiring people.	0
533	TRUMP	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	0
534	WALLACE	Time, Mr. Trump.	0
535	TRUMP	that's offshore back into the country.	0
536	TRUMP	We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...	0
537	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?	0
538	TRUMP	right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.	0
539	CLINTON	Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...	0
540	TRUMP	You can't.	0
541	CLINTON	the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	0
542	CLINTON	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	0
543	CLINTON	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	0
544	CLINTON	I have costed out what I'm going to do.	0
545	CLINTON	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	0
546	CLINTON	Well, he mentioned the debt.	0
547	CLINTON	We know how to get control of the debt.	0
548	CLINTON	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	0
549	CLINTON	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	0
550	CLINTON	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	0
551	CLINTON	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0
552	CLINTON	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
553	CLINTON	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
554	WALLACE	Secretary...	0
555	CLINTON	Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.	0
556	CLINTON	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	0
557	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.	0
558	TRUMP	Correct.	0
559	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.	0
560	WALLACE	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.	0
561	WALLACE	So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?	0
562	CLINTON	Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
563	CLINTON	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	0
564	CLINTON	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.	0
565	CLINTON	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
566	CLINTON	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
567	CLINTON	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
568	CLINTON	But it was a terrible recession.	0
569	CLINTON	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
570	CLINTON	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
571	CLINTON	That is not going to work.	0
572	CLINTON	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	0
573	CLINTON	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	0
574	CLINTON	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0
575	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...	0
576	TRUMP	Over a 10-year period.	0
577	WALLACE	growth is unrealistic.	0
578	WALLACE	And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.	0
579	WALLACE	They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well.	0
580	WALLACE	Your response, sir?	0
581	TRUMP	So I just left some high representatives of India.	0
582	TRUMP	They're growing at 8 percent.	0
583	TRUMP	China is growing at 7 percent.	0
584	TRUMP	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.	0
585	TRUMP	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	0
586	TRUMP	And I think it's going down.	0
587	TRUMP	Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.	0
588	TRUMP	A terrible jobs report.	0
589	TRUMP	In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?	0
590	TRUMP	Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.	0
591	TRUMP	The report was so bad.	0
592	TRUMP	Look, our country is stagnant.	0
593	TRUMP	We've lost our jobs.	0
594	TRUMP	We've lost our businesses.	0
595	TRUMP	We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.	0
596	TRUMP	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	0
597	TRUMP	I've visited so many communities.	0
598	TRUMP	This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.	0
599	TRUMP	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.	0
600	TRUMP	And they cry when they see what's happened.	0
601	TRUMP	I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.	0
602	TRUMP	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.	0
603	TRUMP	Boy, did they suffer.	0
604	TRUMP	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	0
605	TRUMP	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
606	TRUMP	And she wants it.	0
607	TRUMP	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.	1
608	TRUMP	She totally lied.	0
609	TRUMP	She did call it the gold standard.	1
610	TRUMP	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	0
611	TRUMP	I was so honored.	0
612	WALLACE	I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...	0
613	TRUMP	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	0
614	WALLACE	which is Obamacare.	0
615	WALLACE	But go ahead, briefly.	0
616	CLINTON	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	0
617	CLINTON	It didn't meet my test.	0
618	CLINTON	I've had the same test.	0
619	CLINTON	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	0
620	CLINTON	I'm against it now.	0
621	CLINTON	I'll be against it after the election.	0
622	CLINTON	I'll be against it when I'm president.	0
623	CLINTON	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.	0
624	CLINTON	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	0
625	CLINTON	But he mentioned China.	0
626	CLINTON	And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.	0
627	CLINTON	I have fought against that as a senator.	0
628	CLINTON	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.	0
629	CLINTON	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	0
630	CLINTON	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	0
631	CLINTON	So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.	0
632	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?	0
633	CLINTON	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.	0
634	TRUMP	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	0
635	CLINTON	We're going to pull the country together.	0
636	CLINTON	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
637	CLINTON	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	0
638	CLINTON	And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.	0
639	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
640	WALLACE	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
641	TRUMP	Let me ask a simple question.	0
642	TRUMP	She's been doing this for 30 years.	0
643	TRUMP	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?	0
644	CLINTON	No, I voted.	0
645	TRUMP	You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
646	TRUMP	My turn.	0
647	TRUMP	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	0
648	TRUMP	Very much.	0
649	TRUMP	And you do have experience.	0
650	TRUMP	I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.	0
651	TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.	0
652	TRUMP	I wouldn't mind.	0
653	TRUMP	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.	0
654	TRUMP	You don't.	0
655	TRUMP	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.	1
656	TRUMP	How do you miss $6 billion?	0
657	TRUMP	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.	1
658	TRUMP	They don't know.	0
659	TRUMP	It's gone, $6 billion.	1
660	TRUMP	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
661	TRUMP	Believe me.	0
662	CLINTON	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	0
663	CLINTON	But I think it's really an important issue.	0
664	CLINTON	He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.	0
665	CLINTON	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	0
666	CLINTON	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	0
667	CLINTON	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	1
668	CLINTON	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.	0
669	CLINTON	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.	0
670	CLINTON	In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.	0
671	CLINTON	He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.	0
672	TRUMP	Give me a break.	0
673	CLINTON	And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice."	0
674	CLINTON	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	0
675	TRUMP	Well, I think I did a much better job.	0
676	TRUMP	I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.	0
677	TRUMP	I started with a $1 million loan.	0
678	TRUMP	I agree with that.	0
679	TRUMP	It's a $1 million loan.	0
680	TRUMP	But I built a phenomenal company.	0
681	TRUMP	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.	0
682	TRUMP	You would even be proud of it.	0
683	TRUMP	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	0
684	TRUMP	Take a look at the migration.	0
685	TRUMP	Take a look at Libya.	0
686	TRUMP	Take a look at Iraq.	0
687	TRUMP	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.	1
688	TRUMP	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.	1
689	TRUMP	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.	0
690	TRUMP	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	0
691	TRUMP	She's going to get rid of nobody.	0
692	WALLACE	All right.	0
693	WALLACE	We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States.	0
694	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it.	0
695	WALLACE	And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.	1
696	WALLACE	Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?	0
697	WALLACE	Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse.	0
698	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first.	0
699	TRUMP	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
700	TRUMP	Those people -- I don't know those people.	0
701	TRUMP	I have a feeling how they came.	0
702	TRUMP	I believe it was her campaign that did it.	0
703	TRUMP	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	0
704	TRUMP	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.	0
705	TRUMP	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	0
706	TRUMP	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.	0
707	TRUMP	And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.	0
708	TRUMP	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.	0
709	TRUMP	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	0
710	TRUMP	And I think it's her campaign.	0
711	TRUMP	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	0
712	TRUMP	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	0
713	TRUMP	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	0
714	TRUMP	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
715	TRUMP	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
716	TRUMP	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.	0
717	TRUMP	It was lies, and it was fiction.	0
718	CLINTON	Well...	0
719	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
720	CLINTON	At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.	0
721	CLINTON	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	0
722	CLINTON	Now, what was his response?	0
723	CLINTON	Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.	0
724	TRUMP	I did not say that.	0
725	TRUMP	I did not say that.	0
726	CLINTON	In fact, he went on to say...	0
727	WALLACE	Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.	0
728	WALLACE	Her two minutes.	0
729	TRUMP	I did not say that.	0
730	WALLACE	It's her two minutes.	0
731	CLINTON	He went on to say, "Look at her.	0
732	CLINTON	I don't think so."	0
733	CLINTON	About another woman, he said, "That wouldn't be my first choice."	0
734	CLINTON	He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her "disgusting," as he has called a number of women during this campaign.	0
735	CLINTON	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	0
736	CLINTON	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
737	CLINTON	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.	0
738	CLINTON	That's who Donald is.	0
739	CLINTON	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
740	CLINTON	America is great, because America is good.	0
741	CLINTON	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
742	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...	0
743	TRUMP	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
744	TRUMP	Nobody.	0
745	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
746	TRUMP	Nobody has more respect...	0
747	WALLACE	Please, everybody.	0
748	TRUMP	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	0
749	TRUMP	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.	0
750	TRUMP	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.	0
751	TRUMP	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
752	TRUMP	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	0
753	TRUMP	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	0
754	TRUMP	One lie.	0
755	TRUMP	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	0
756	TRUMP	He's going to probably go to jail.	0
757	TRUMP	This is a four-star general.	0
758	TRUMP	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	0
759	TRUMP	That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.	0
760	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
761	CLINTON	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	0
762	CLINTON	And it's not just about women.	0
763	CLINTON	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	0
764	CLINTON	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0
765	CLINTON	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	1
766	TRUMP	Wrong.	1
767	CLINTON	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	0
768	CLINTON	He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers "people who aren't captured."	0
769	CLINTON	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	0
770	CLINTON	So it's not one thing.	0
771	CLINTON	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	0
772	CLINTON	That is not who America is.	0
773	CLINTON	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
774	CLINTON	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.	0
775	TRUMP	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	0
776	TRUMP	It's on tape.	0
777	WALLACE	During the last...	0
778	TRUMP	The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...	0
779	WALLACE	OK.	0
780	TRUMP	but those other charges, as she knows, are false.	0
781	WALLACE	In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.	0
782	WALLACE	I'd like to ask you about them.	0
783	WALLACE	These are questions that the American people have.	0
784	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you.	0
785	WALLACE	Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.	0
786	WALLACE	Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?	0
787	WALLACE	And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?	0
788	CLINTON	Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.	0
789	CLINTON	The State Department has said that.	0
790	CLINTON	I think that's been proven.	0
791	CLINTON	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.	0
792	CLINTON	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	0
793	CLINTON	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.	1
794	CLINTON	In partnership with the American Health Association...	0
795	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton...	0
796	CLINTON	we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	0
797	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.	0
798	CLINTON	Well, it is an open discussion.	0
799	CLINTON	And you...	0
800	WALLACE	And the specific question went to pay for play.	0
801	WALLACE	Do you want to talk about that?	0
802	CLINTON	Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...	0
803	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
804	TRUMP	I think that it's been very well...	0
805	WALLACE	Let's ask Mr. Trump.	0
806	CLINTON	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...	0
807	TRUMP	It's been very well studied.	0
808	CLINTON	and the high rankings...	0
809	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
810	WALLACE	Please let me Mr. Trump speak.	0
811	TRUMP	and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	0
812	WALLACE	Please let Mr. Trump speak.	0
813	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
814	TRUMP	It's a criminal enterprise.	0
815	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	1
816	TRUMP	You talk about women and women's rights?	0
817	TRUMP	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.	0
818	TRUMP	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	1
819	TRUMP	And yet you take their money.	0
820	TRUMP	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	1
821	TRUMP	Why don't you give back the money?	0
822	TRUMP	I think it would be a great gesture.	0
823	TRUMP	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.	0
824	TRUMP	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	0
825	TRUMP	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	0
826	TRUMP	And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.	0
827	TRUMP	And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.	0
828	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
829	CLINTON	Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.	0
830	CLINTON	I'm very proud of that.	0
831	CLINTON	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	0
832	CLINTON	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	1
833	CLINTON	I mean, who does that?	0
834	CLINTON	It just was astonishing.	0
835	CLINTON	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	0
836	CLINTON	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	0
837	CLINTON	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.	0
838	CLINTON	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.	0
839	CLINTON	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.	0
840	CLINTON	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	0
841	WALLACE	All right.	0
842	CLINTON	because it's an important part of the American experience.	0
843	TRUMP	They don't want you to help them anymore.	0
844	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
845	TRUMP	I'd like to mention one thing.	0
846	TRUMP	Trump Foundation, small foundation.	0
847	TRUMP	People contribute, I contribute.	0
848	TRUMP	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	0
849	TRUMP	I don't get anything.	0
850	TRUMP	I don't buy boats.	0
851	TRUMP	I don't buy planes.	0
852	TRUMP	What happens -- the money goes to them.	0
853	WALLACE	Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?	0
854	TRUMP	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	0
855	TRUMP	And that's it.	0
856	TRUMP	They put up the American flag.	0
857	TRUMP	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.	0
858	WALLACE	Right.	0
859	WALLACE	But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...	0
860	TRUMP	There was.	0
861	TRUMP	There was.	0
862	TRUMP	And, by the way...	0
863	WALLACE	instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.	0
864	TRUMP	the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	0
865	WALLACE	I want to get into one...	0
866	CLINTON	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	0
867	CLINTON	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	1
868	CLINTON	You can look at our tax returns.	0
869	CLINTON	We've got them all out there.	0
870	CLINTON	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	0
871	CLINTON	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
872	CLINTON	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	0
873	CLINTON	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	0
874	CLINTON	I find that just astonishing.	0
875	WALLACE	I want...	0
876	TRUMP	So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.	0
877	TRUMP	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	1
878	WALLACE	We...	0
879	TRUMP	Let me just explain.	0
880	WALLACE	But, no, we heard this...	0
881	TRUMP	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.	0
882	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, we -- OK.	0
883	TRUMP	You know what she should have done?	0
884	WALLACE	Folks, we heard this...	0
885	TRUMP	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	0
886	WALLACE	Folks, we heard this...	0
887	TRUMP	because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	0
888	CLINTON	Well, you know...	0
889	TRUMP	You should have changed the law.	0
890	TRUMP	But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.	0
891	TRUMP	I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...	0
892	CLINTON	Made with Chinese steel.	0
893	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I sat there...	0
894	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
895	TRUMP	I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	0
896	TRUMP	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.	0
897	TRUMP	And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.	0
898	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...	0
899	TRUMP	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	0
900	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.	0
901	WALLACE	You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.	0
902	WALLACE	Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- "will absolutely accept the result of this election."	0
903	WALLACE	Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing.	0
904	WALLACE	I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?	0
905	TRUMP	I will look at it at the time.	0
906	TRUMP	I'm not looking at anything now.	0
907	TRUMP	I'll look at it at the time.	0
908	TRUMP	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.	0
909	TRUMP	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	0
910	TRUMP	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	0
911	TRUMP	It's so dishonest.	0
912	TRUMP	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	0
913	TRUMP	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	0
914	TRUMP	I think they're going to see through it.	0
915	TRUMP	We'll find out on November 8th.	0
916	TRUMP	But I think they're going to see through it.	0
917	WALLACE	But, sir, there's...	0
918	TRUMP	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	1
919	TRUMP	So let me just give you one other thing.	0
920	TRUMP	So I talk about the corrupt media.	0
921	TRUMP	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
922	TRUMP	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
923	TRUMP	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	0
924	TRUMP	She should not be allowed to run.	0
925	TRUMP	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	0
926	WALLACE	But...	0
927	TRUMP	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	0
928	WALLACE	But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.	0
929	WALLACE	Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.	0
930	WALLACE	Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?	0
931	TRUMP	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0
932	TRUMP	I'll keep you in suspense.	0
933	TRUMP	OK?	0
934	CLINTON	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	0
935	CLINTON	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	0
936	CLINTON	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	0
937	CLINTON	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	0
938	CLINTON	He lost the Iowa caucus.	0
939	CLINTON	He lost the Wisconsin primary.	0
940	CLINTON	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	0
941	CLINTON	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.	0
942	CLINTON	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	1
943	TRUMP	Should have gotten it.	0
944	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
945	CLINTON	This is -- this is a mindset.	0
946	CLINTON	This is how Donald thinks.	0
947	CLINTON	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	0
948	WALLACE	OK.	0
949	CLINTON	So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
950	CLINTON	We've been around for 240 years.	0
951	CLINTON	We've had free and fair elections.	0
952	CLINTON	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	0
953	CLINTON	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
954	CLINTON	You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...	0
955	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
956	WALLACE	Hold on.	0
957	WALLACE	Hold on, folks.	0
958	WALLACE	Hold on, folks.	0
959	CLINTON	it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	0
960	CLINTON	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0
961	CLINTON	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	0
962	CLINTON	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	0
963	TRUMP	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	0
964	TRUMP	I think it's a disgrace.	0
965	WALLACE	All right.	0
966	TRUMP	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.	0
967	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
968	WALLACE	Hold on, folks.	0
969	WALLACE	This doesn't do any good for anyone.	0
970	WALLACE	Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.	0
971	WALLACE	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.	0
972	WALLACE	If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?	0
973	WALLACE	And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.	0
974	WALLACE	Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?	0
975	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.	0
976	WALLACE	You have two minutes.	0
977	CLINTON	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	0
978	CLINTON	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0
979	CLINTON	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0
980	CLINTON	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0
981	CLINTON	The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0
982	CLINTON	It's going to be a hard fight.	0
983	CLINTON	I've got no illusions about that.	0
984	CLINTON	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	0
985	CLINTON	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0
986	CLINTON	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
987	CLINTON	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	0
988	CLINTON	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	0
989	CLINTON	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	0
990	CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
991	CLINTON	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
992	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, same question.	0
993	WALLACE	If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?	0
994	TRUMP	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	0
995	TRUMP	We had Mosul.	0
996	TRUMP	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	0
997	TRUMP	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	0
998	TRUMP	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	0
999	TRUMP	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	0
1000	TRUMP	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0
1001	TRUMP	We announce we're going after Mosul.	0
1002	TRUMP	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	0
1003	TRUMP	These people have all left.	0
1004	TRUMP	They've all left.	0
1005	TRUMP	The element of surprise.	0
1006	TRUMP	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	0
1007	TRUMP	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	0
1008	TRUMP	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0
1009	TRUMP	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0
1010	TRUMP	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
1011	TRUMP	They want to look good.	0
1012	TRUMP	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	0
1013	TRUMP	That's why we have the great migration.	0
1014	TRUMP	But she wanted to look good for the election.	0
1015	TRUMP	So they're going in.	0
1016	TRUMP	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0
1017	TRUMP	We'll take Mosul eventually.	0
1018	TRUMP	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0
1019	TRUMP	Much, much tougher.	0
1020	TRUMP	Much more dangerous.	0
1021	TRUMP	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
1022	TRUMP	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	0
1023	TRUMP	They say, what do we need this for?	0
1024	TRUMP	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0
1025	TRUMP	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	0
1026	TRUMP	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	0
1027	TRUMP	So we're now going to take Mosul.	0
1028	TRUMP	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0
1029	TRUMP	Iran.	0
1030	TRUMP	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	0
1031	TRUMP	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	0
1032	TRUMP	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	0
1033	TRUMP	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
1034	WALLACE	Sir, your two minutes are up.	0
1035	TRUMP	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
1036	CLINTON	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	1
1037	CLINTON	I said it was a mistake.	1
1038	CLINTON	I've said that years ago.	1
1039	CLINTON	He has consistently denied what is...	1
1040	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1041	CLINTON	a very clear fact that...	0
1042	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1043	CLINTON	before the invasion, he supported it.	0
1044	CLINTON	And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.	0
1045	CLINTON	Google "Donald Trump Iraq."	0
1046	CLINTON	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	0
1047	TRUMP	Wrong.	0
1048	CLINTON	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	0
1049	CLINTON	Now, why does that matter?	0
1050	CLINTON	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	0
1051	CLINTON	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	0
1052	CLINTON	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
1053	CLINTON	Mosul is a Sunni city.	0
1054	CLINTON	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	0
1055	CLINTON	And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice," and we brought him to justice.	0
1056	CLINTON	We need to go after the leadership.	0
1057	CLINTON	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	0
1058	CLINTON	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.	0
1059	CLINTON	They've been digging underground.	0
1060	CLINTON	They've been prepared to defend.	0
1061	CLINTON	It's going to be tough fighting.	0
1062	CLINTON	But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.	0
1063	CLINTON	This is what we have to do.	0
1064	CLINTON	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0
1065	CLINTON	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	0
1066	TRUMP	Chris, we don't gain anything.	0
1067	CLINTON	He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
1068	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1069	TRUMP	Iran is taking over Iraq.	0
1070	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, it's...	0
1071	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1072	TRUMP	Iran is taking over Iraq.	0
1073	TRUMP	We don't gain anything.	0
1074	CLINTON	This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.	0
1075	TRUMP	If they did it by surprise...	0
1076	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1077	WALLACE	Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.	0
1078	CLINTON	He says...	0
1079	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1080	TRUMP	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.	0
1081	WALLACE	Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.	0
1082	CLINTON	unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.	0
1083	TRUMP	No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
1084	TRUMP	You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.	0
1085	TRUMP	He said some beauties.	0
1086	TRUMP	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	0
1087	TRUMP	You do.	0
1088	TRUMP	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	0
1089	TRUMP	If you think that was good, then you do.	0
1090	TRUMP	Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.	0
1091	TRUMP	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.	0
1092	TRUMP	I agree with both.	0
1093	CLINTON	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	0
1094	CLINTON	And he has said...	0
1095	TRUMP	Which is a big mistake.	0
1096	CLINTON	as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.	0
1097	CLINTON	I think he's right.	0
1098	WALLACE	Let's turn to Aleppo.	0
1099	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo.	0
1100	WALLACE	And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir.	0
1101	WALLACE	You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.	0
1102	WALLACE	In fact, there -- in fact, there are...	0
1103	TRUMP	It's a catastrophe.	0
1104	TRUMP	I mean...	0
1105	WALLACE	It's a catastrophe, but there...	0
1106	TRUMP	it's a mess.	0
1107	WALLACE	There are a quarter of...	0
1108	TRUMP	Have you seen it?	0
1109	TRUMP	Have you seen it?	0
1110	WALLACE	Sir...	0
1111	TRUMP	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	0
1112	WALLACE	Sir, if I may finish my question...	0
1113	TRUMP	OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
1114	TRUMP	Take a look at it.	0
1115	WALLACE	Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.	0
1116	TRUMP	That's right.	0
1117	TRUMP	And they are being slaughtered...	0
1118	WALLACE	Yes.	0
1119	TRUMP	because of bad decisions.	0
1120	WALLACE	If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.	0
1121	WALLACE	In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.	0
1122	WALLACE	Would you like to clear that up, sir?	0
1123	TRUMP	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	0
1124	TRUMP	It's a humanitarian nightmare.	0
1125	TRUMP	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	0
1126	TRUMP	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	0
1127	TRUMP	Take a look at Aleppo.	0
1128	TRUMP	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	0
1129	TRUMP	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	0
1130	TRUMP	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0
1131	TRUMP	He -- he aligned with Russia.	0
1132	TRUMP	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	0
1133	TRUMP	We gave them $150 billion back.	1
1134	TRUMP	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	0
1135	TRUMP	I mean, cash.	0
1136	TRUMP	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	0
1137	TRUMP	We gave them $1.7 billion.	0
1138	TRUMP	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	0
1139	TRUMP	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	0
1140	TRUMP	We don't know who the rebels are.	0
1141	TRUMP	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	0
1142	TRUMP	We don't know who the rebels are.	0
1143	TRUMP	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	0
1144	TRUMP	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	0
1145	TRUMP	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0
1146	TRUMP	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	0
1147	WALLACE	Let me...	0
1148	TRUMP	in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	0
1149	TRUMP	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0
1150	TRUMP	Lots of luck, Hillary.	0
1151	TRUMP	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0
1152	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.	0
1153	WALLACE	President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.	0
1154	WALLACE	And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.	0
1155	WALLACE	So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?	0
1156	WALLACE	Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?	0
1157	CLINTON	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	0
1158	CLINTON	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	0
1159	CLINTON	This would not be done just on the first day.	0
1160	CLINTON	This would take a lot of negotiation.	0
1161	CLINTON	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0
1162	CLINTON	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	0
1163	CLINTON	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0
1164	CLINTON	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
1165	CLINTON	He's made these claims repeatedly.	0
1166	CLINTON	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	0
1167	CLINTON	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	0
1168	CLINTON	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	0
1169	CLINTON	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0
1170	CLINTON	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	0
1171	CLINTON	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	0
1172	CLINTON	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0
1173	CLINTON	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0
1174	WALLACE	Folks, I want to get into our final segment.	0
1175	TRUMP	But I just have to...	0
1176	WALLACE	Real quick.	0
1177	TRUMP	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	0
1178	TRUMP	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0
1179	TRUMP	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	0
1180	WALLACE	OK.	0
1181	TRUMP	We should have -- wait one second.	0
1182	TRUMP	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	0
1183	TRUMP	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0
1184	TRUMP	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	0
1185	TRUMP	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	0
1186	TRUMP	They are outplayed.	0
1187	TRUMP	Now, she wasn't there.	0
1188	TRUMP	I assume she had nothing to do with it.	0
1189	TRUMP	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	0
1190	TRUMP	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	0
1191	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.	0
1192	WALLACE	Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.	0
1193	WALLACE	That's the highest since just after World War II.	0
1194	WALLACE	But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	0
1195	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	0
1196	WALLACE	The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?	0
1197	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you go first.	0
1198	TRUMP	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	0
1199	TRUMP	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	0
1200	TRUMP	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	0
1201	TRUMP	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
1202	TRUMP	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
1203	TRUMP	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0
1204	TRUMP	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0
1205	TRUMP	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0
1206	TRUMP	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	0
1207	TRUMP	It's very sad.	0
1208	TRUMP	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0
1209	TRUMP	We used to be there.	0
1210	TRUMP	We've given it up.	0
1211	TRUMP	We've become very, very sloppy.	0
1212	TRUMP	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	0
1213	TRUMP	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0
1214	TRUMP	But we don't use those people.	0
1215	TRUMP	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0
1216	TRUMP	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0
1217	TRUMP	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0
1218	TRUMP	We use political hacks.	0
1219	TRUMP	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0
1220	TRUMP	So we have to use our great people.	0
1221	TRUMP	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0
1222	TRUMP	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
1223	TRUMP	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0
1224	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton?	0
1225	CLINTON	Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.	0
1226	CLINTON	And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.	0
1227	CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	0
1228	CLINTON	He was criticizing President Reagan.	0
1229	CLINTON	This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.	0
1230	CLINTON	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	0
1231	CLINTON	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	0
1232	CLINTON	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0
1233	CLINTON	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0
1234	CLINTON	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
1235	CLINTON	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	0
1236	CLINTON	In fact, I think just the opposite.	0
1237	CLINTON	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0
1238	CLINTON	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0
1239	CLINTON	That's where growth will come from.	0
1240	CLINTON	That's why I want to invest in you.	0
1241	CLINTON	I want to invest in your family.	0
1242	CLINTON	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0
1243	CLINTON	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	0
1244	CLINTON	It may be because of our experiences.	0
1245	CLINTON	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	0
1246	TRUMP	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	0
1247	CLINTON	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	0
1248	TRUMP	We've heard this before.	0
1249	CLINTON	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0
1250	WALLACE	Time.	0
1251	TRUMP	Thank you, Hillary.	0
1252	TRUMP	Could I just respond?	0
1253	WALLACE	Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...	0
1254	TRUMP	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	0
1255	TRUMP	I disagreed with him.	0
1256	TRUMP	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0
1257	TRUMP	I've been waiting for years.	0
1258	TRUMP	Nobody does it right.	0
1259	WALLACE	OK.	0
1260	TRUMP	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0
1261	WALLACE	All right.	0
1262	WALLACE	The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.	0
1263	WALLACE	Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.	0
1264	WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	0
1265	TRUMP	I'm cutting taxes.	0
1266	TRUMP	We're going to grow the economy.	0
1267	TRUMP	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
1268	WALLACE	That's not going to help in the entitlements.	0
1269	TRUMP	No, it's going to totally help you.	0
1270	TRUMP	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
1271	TRUMP	It's destroying our country.	0
1272	TRUMP	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	0
1273	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
1274	TRUMP	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	0
1275	TRUMP	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	0
1276	TRUMP	But Obamacare has to go.	0
1277	TRUMP	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	1
1278	TRUMP	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0
1279	TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	0
1280	TRUMP	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	0
1281	TRUMP	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
1282	WALLACE	And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.	0
1283	WALLACE	Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?	0
1284	CLINTON	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
1285	CLINTON	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0
1286	CLINTON	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	0
1287	CLINTON	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0
1288	TRUMP	Such a nasty woman.	0
1289	CLINTON	by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0
1290	CLINTON	I will not cut benefits.	0
1291	CLINTON	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0
1292	CLINTON	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	0
1293	CLINTON	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	0
1294	CLINTON	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	0
1295	CLINTON	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	0
1296	CLINTON	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	0
1297	CLINTON	What we need to do is go after...	0
1298	TRUMP	Your husband disagrees with you.	0
1299	CLINTON	the long-term health care drivers.	0
1300	CLINTON	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0
1301	CLINTON	I have a plan for doing that.	0
1302	CLINTON	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	0
1303	WALLACE	This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign.	0
1304	WALLACE	I would like to end it on a positive note.	0
1305	WALLACE	You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.	0
1306	WALLACE	So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.	0
1307	WALLACE	This is another new mini-segment.	0
1308	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.	0
1309	CLINTON	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
1310	CLINTON	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0
1311	CLINTON	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	0
1312	CLINTON	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0
1313	CLINTON	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	0
1314	CLINTON	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0
1315	CLINTON	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0
1316	CLINTON	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	0
1317	CLINTON	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	0
1318	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
1319	WALLACE	Mr. Trump?	0
1320	TRUMP	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.	0
1321	TRUMP	Doesn't work that way.	0
1322	TRUMP	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.	0
1323	TRUMP	It's called "Make America Great Again."	0
1324	TRUMP	We're going to make America great.	0
1325	TRUMP	We have a depleted military.	0
1326	TRUMP	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	0
1327	TRUMP	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
1328	TRUMP	We don't take care of our veterans.	0
1329	TRUMP	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	1
1330	TRUMP	That can't happen.	0
1331	TRUMP	Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
1332	TRUMP	We need law and order, but we need justice, too.	0
1333	TRUMP	Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
1334	TRUMP	You get shot walking to the store.	0
1335	TRUMP	They have no education.	0
1336	TRUMP	They have no jobs.	0
1337	TRUMP	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.	0
1338	TRUMP	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.	0
1339	TRUMP	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	0
1340	TRUMP	We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.	0
1341	WALLACE	Thank you both.	0
1342	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1343	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks.	0
1344	WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.	0
1345	WALLACE	That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
1346	WALLACE	We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us.	0
1347	WALLACE	Now the decision is up to you.	0
1348	WALLACE	While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away.	0
1349	WALLACE	One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote.	0
1350	WALLACE	It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.	0
1351	WALLACE	Thank you, and good night.	0
