17	Melania Trump	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.	0
18	Donald Trump	Thank you, everybody, thank you.	0
19	Donald Trump	I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.	0
20	Donald Trump	It's so great to be here in Florida.	0
21	Donald Trump	My second home with you.	0
22	Donald Trump	This is a state I truly love.	0
23	Donald Trump	This is a state where we all had great victory together.	0
24	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
25	Donald Trump	It's now been a month since my inauguration.	0
26	Donald Trump	And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again.	0
27	Donald Trump	I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.	0
28	Donald Trump	I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people.	0
29	Donald Trump	This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else.	0
30	Donald Trump	This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you.	0
31	Donald Trump	I promise you that.	0
32	Donald Trump	I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.	0
33	Donald Trump	I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news.	0
34	Donald Trump	The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years.	0
35	Donald Trump	They don't get it.	0
36	Donald Trump	By they're starting to get it.	0
37	Donald Trump	I can tell you that.	0
38	Donald Trump	They've become a big part of the problem.	0
39	Donald Trump	They are part of the corrupt system.	0
40	Donald Trump	Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies.	0
41	Donald Trump	When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it.	0
42	Donald Trump	I will do whatever I can that.	0
43	Donald Trump	They don't get away with it.	0
44	Donald Trump	They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda.	0
45	Donald Trump	In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807.	0
46	Donald Trump	But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.	0
47	Donald Trump	We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.	0
48	Donald Trump	We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.	0
49	Donald Trump	We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.	0
50	Donald Trump	I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver.	0
51	Donald Trump	I promise that.	0
52	Donald Trump	And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time.	0
53	Donald Trump	The White House is running so smoothly.	0
54	Donald Trump	So smoothly.	0
55	Donald Trump	And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess.	0
56	Donald Trump	That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.	0
57	Donald Trump	We will have strong borders again, and I mean that.	0
58	Donald Trump	You've seen it in television.	0
59	Donald Trump	You've seen it on television.	0
60	Donald Trump	General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job.	0
61	Donald Trump	You're seeing it.	0
62	Donald Trump	The gang members, bad, bad people.	0
63	Donald Trump	I said day one, and they're going out.	0
64	Donald Trump	Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here.	0
65	Donald Trump	Bring them back to where they came from.	0
66	Donald Trump	The fact is, you want great schools for your children.	0
67	Donald Trump	You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families.	0
68	Donald Trump	You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
69	Donald Trump	It will be repealed and replaced.	0
70	Donald Trump	For those people.	0
71	Donald Trump	The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast.	0
72	Donald Trump	Okay?	0
73	Donald Trump	Nothing to complain about.	0
74	Donald Trump	Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.	0
75	Donald Trump	You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal.	0
76	Donald Trump	We're going to put the miners back to work.	0
77	Donald Trump	The miners go back to work.	0
78	Donald Trump	You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.	0
79	Donald Trump	You want fair trade deals and a level playing field.	0
80	Donald Trump	We don't have a level playing field.	0
81	Donald Trump	Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the	0
82	SYSTEM	[inaudible]	0
83	Donald Trump	of our politicians.	0
84	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen any longer.	0
85	Donald Trump	You want lower taxes.	0
86	Donald Trump	Less regulation.	0
87	Donald Trump	Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America.	0
88	Donald Trump	And harder for companies to leave.	0
89	Donald Trump	We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired.	0
90	Donald Trump	We're moving to another country.	0
91	Donald Trump	We're going to make the product.	0
92	Donald Trump	Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful.	0
93	Donald Trump	Not going happen anymore.	0
94	Donald Trump	We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave.	0
95	Donald Trump	They will never, ever leave.	0
96	Donald Trump	And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office.	0
97	Donald Trump	They're not leaving.	0
98	Donald Trump	And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers.	0
99	Donald Trump	You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest.	0
100	Donald Trump	You want a government that keeps its promises.	0
101	Donald Trump	A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it.	0
102	Donald Trump	it's sweeping all across the country.	0
103	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening to the stock market.	0
104	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country.	0
105	Donald Trump	It's sweeping across the country.	0
106	Donald Trump	And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs.	0
107	Donald Trump	They're going to start highs.	0
108	Donald Trump	It's going to be a new day in America.	0
109	Donald Trump	You're going to be proud again.	0
110	Donald Trump	Jobs are already starting to pour back in.	0
111	Donald Trump	They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time.	0
112	Donald Trump	Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country.	0
113	Donald Trump	In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.	0
114	Donald Trump	I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
115	Donald Trump	TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it.	0
116	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one.	0
117	Donald Trump	None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand.	0
118	Donald Trump	Get mired in and we can't do anything about it.	0
119	Donald Trump	By the way, NAFTA and so many others.	0
120	Donald Trump	My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers.	0
121	Donald Trump	We're going to end it.	0
122	Donald Trump	Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines.	0
123	Donald Trump	Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs.	0
124	Donald Trump	And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe?	0
125	Donald Trump	Who makes the pipe?	0
126	Donald Trump	Something this audience understands very well, right?	0
127	Donald Trump	Simple question.	0
128	Donald Trump	The lawyers put this very complex document in front.	0
129	Donald Trump	I said, who makes the pipe?	0
130	Donald Trump	They said, sir, it can be made anywhere.	0
131	Donald Trump	I said not anymore.	0
132	Donald Trump	I put a little clause in the bottom.	0
133	Donald Trump	The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.	0
134	Donald Trump	We believe in two simple rules.	0
135	Donald Trump	I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger.	0
136	Donald Trump	For the big planes.	0
137	Donald Trump	And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd.	0
138	Donald Trump	Not one.	0
139	Donald Trump	Not one.	0
140	Donald Trump	They won't show the crowd.	0
141	Donald Trump	You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.	0
142	Donald Trump	And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One.	0
143	Donald Trump	Can you believe this?	0
144	Donald Trump	I said no way.	0
145	Donald Trump	I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane.	0
146	Donald Trump	I refuse.	0
147	Donald Trump	So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know.	0
148	Donald Trump	The Air Force One project is actually two planes.	0
149	Donald Trump	Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project.	0
150	Donald Trump	I got the generals in who are fantastic.	0
151	Donald Trump	I got Boeing in.	0
152	Donald Trump	I told Boeing it's not good enough.	0
153	Donald Trump	We're still not going to do it.	0
154	Donald Trump	The price is still too high.	0
155	Donald Trump	On the fighter jet.	0
156	Donald Trump	We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.	1
157	Donald Trump	Seven years late, great plane.	0
158	Donald Trump	A great plane.	0
159	Donald Trump	So think of it.	0
160	Donald Trump	They're seven years late.	0
161	Donald Trump	Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget.	1
162	Donald Trump	Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well.	0
163	Donald Trump	And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way.	0
164	Donald Trump	I also got Boeing in.	0
165	Donald Trump	I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer.	0
166	Donald Trump	And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them.	0
167	Donald Trump	They would have signed contracts.	0
168	Donald Trump	So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump.	0
169	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.	0
170	Donald Trump	You might as well know about it.	0
171	Donald Trump	Nobody talks.	0
172	Donald Trump	By the way, that's for fighter jets.	0
173	Donald Trump	One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation.	0
174	Donald Trump	The order for the F-35.	0
175	Donald Trump	You've been reading about it because it was a disaster.	0
176	Donald Trump	Under the last administration.	0
177	Donald Trump	A disaster.	0
178	Donald Trump	And now we have it running beautifully.	0
179	Donald Trump	In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great.	0
180	Donald Trump	Great guy.	0
181	Donald Trump	When he came over, he said, thank you.	0
182	Donald Trump	I said for what.	0
183	Donald Trump	You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet.	0
184	Donald Trump	Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation.	0
185	Donald Trump	So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good.	0
186	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
187	Donald Trump	That's good.	0
188	Donald Trump	I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?	0
189	Donald Trump	But we believe in two simple rules.	0
190	Donald Trump	Buy American and hire American.	0
191	Donald Trump	We believe it.	0
192	Donald Trump	We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
193	Donald Trump	And by the way, a new director was just approved.	0
194	Donald Trump	Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time.	0
195	Donald Trump	Incredible people.	0
196	Donald Trump	Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency.	0
197	Donald Trump	He'll do so good.	0
198	Donald Trump	He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected.	0
199	Donald Trump	They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly.	0
200	Donald Trump	For the most part, they're going to be accepted.	0
201	Donald Trump	They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary.	0
202	Donald Trump	He will be amazing.	0
203	Donald Trump	We're very happy.	0
204	Donald Trump	That took place yesterday.	0
205	Donald Trump	That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations.	0
206	Donald Trump	It was impossible to navigate for companies.	0
207	Donald Trump	And what did it really mean?	0
208	Donald Trump	Forget about the companies?	0
209	Donald Trump	What did it mean.	0
210	Donald Trump	It meant no jobs.	0
211	Donald Trump	It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here.	0
212	Donald Trump	So we're going to have a whole big situation.	0
213	Donald Trump	We are going to unfreeze all of those companies.	0
214	Donald Trump	They are going to be — they're going have freedom.	0
215	Donald Trump	Be able to build what they want to build.	0
216	Donald Trump	It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before.	0
217	Donald Trump	That's going to happen.	0
218	Donald Trump	That was a big thing.	0
219	Donald Trump	We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement.	0
220	Donald Trump	We're standing up.	0
221	Donald Trump	And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up.	0
222	Donald Trump	I don't say for me.	0
223	Donald Trump	I'm the messenger folks.	0
224	Donald Trump	I'm the messenger.	0
225	Donald Trump	They stood up for us in this last election.	0
226	Donald Trump	We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military.	0
227	Donald Trump	Basically people they wear uniforms like us.	0
228	Donald Trump	Isn't that nice.	0
229	Donald Trump	I saw this man on TV just now, you.	0
230	Donald Trump	I just saw him on television.	0
231	Donald Trump	He said I love Trump.	0
232	Donald Trump	Let Trump do what he has to do.	0
233	Donald Trump	That's my guy right there.	0
234	Donald Trump	Come here.	0
235	Donald Trump	Come here.	0
236	Donald Trump	No, I just.	0
237	Donald Trump	I'm coming in.	0
238	Donald Trump	That's okay.	0
239	Donald Trump	Let him up.	0
240	Donald Trump	I'm not worried about him.	0
241	Donald Trump	I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss.	0
242	Donald Trump	I'm not worried about anything else.	0
243	Donald Trump	This guy is so great.	0
244	Donald Trump	He was one of many people.	0
245	Donald Trump	They're interviewing people in the line.	0
246	Donald Trump	And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man.	0
247	Donald Trump	Come on up here.	0
248	Donald Trump	Come on up.	0
249	Donald Trump	Guy was great.	0
250	Donald Trump	Hop over the fence.	0
251	Donald Trump	Come on.	0
252	Donald Trump	He can do it.	0
253	Donald Trump	He's in good shape.	0
254	Donald Trump	Look at him.	0
255	Donald Trump	Look at this guy.	0
256	Donald Trump	Come on.	0
257	Donald Trump	This guy is great.	0
258	Donald Trump	Don't worry about him.	0
259	Donald Trump	No, no.	0
260	Donald Trump	Come here.	0
261	Donald Trump	They're going to — come on up.	0
262	Donald Trump	Come here.	0
263	Donald Trump	This guy.	0
264	Donald Trump	So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.	0
265	Unidentified Male	I did sir.	0
266	Donald Trump	Say a couple of words to this crowd.	0
267	Unidentified Male	Mr. President, thank you sir.	0
268	Unidentified Male	We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today.	0
269	Unidentified Male	When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.	0
270	Unidentified Male	Thank you so much, sir.	0
271	Donald Trump	A star is born.	0
272	Unidentified Male	A star is born.	0
273	Unidentified Male	That's fine.	0
274	Donald Trump	I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right?	0
275	Donald Trump	We know our people.	0
276	Donald Trump	Great guy.	0
277	Donald Trump	And so many others.	0
278	Donald Trump	I see some others.	0
279	Donald Trump	Being interviewed.	0
280	Donald Trump	I see them over here.	0
281	Donald Trump	They started.	0
282	Donald Trump	They came at 4 in the morning.	0
283	Donald Trump	The media will give them no credit.	0
284	Donald Trump	The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.	0
285	Donald Trump	All the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get.	0
286	Donald Trump	All the way outside.	0
287	Donald Trump	Way back to the fences.	0
288	Donald Trump	Amazing.	0
289	Donald Trump	I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.	0
290	Donald Trump	I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them.	0
291	Donald Trump	We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now.	0
292	Donald Trump	It's very unfair what's happening.	0
293	Donald Trump	So we want to cherish our law enforcement.	0
294	Donald Trump	We will always protect those who protect us.	0
295	Donald Trump	We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities.	0
296	Donald Trump	We're going to make our inner cities safe again.	0
297	Donald Trump	Look at what's going on.	0
298	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening in Chicago.	0
299	Donald Trump	Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths.	0
300	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places.	0
301	Donald Trump	Safety is a civil right.	0
302	Donald Trump	And we will fight to make America totally safe again.	0
303	Donald Trump	I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth.	0
304	Donald Trump	We're stopping it.	0
305	Donald Trump	We're stopping it.	0
306	Donald Trump	We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.	0
307	Donald Trump	And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country.	0
308	Donald Trump	So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing.	0
309	Donald Trump	And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad.	0
310	Donald Trump	The reason is for protection and safety.	0
311	Donald Trump	So the statute is so plain and so clear.	0
312	Donald Trump	I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its.	0
313	Donald Trump	If you have a high school education, you can understand it.	0
314	Donald Trump	If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.	0
315	Donald Trump	I was told.	0
316	Donald Trump	I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court.	0
317	Donald Trump	Three judges.	0
318	Donald Trump	And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television.	0
319	Donald Trump	Everything we do gets a lot of people watching.	0
320	Donald Trump	So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good.	0
321	Donald Trump	When they wrote their decision, as I understand it.	0
322	Donald Trump	Maybe I'm wrong.	0
323	Donald Trump	They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side.	0
324	Donald Trump	So I thought I would read it.	0
325	Donald Trump	And here's what it says.	0
326	Donald Trump	This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay.	0
327	Donald Trump	So essentially.	0
328	Donald Trump	Whenever somebody comes into the United States.	0
329	Donald Trump	Right.	0
330	Donald Trump	“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay.	0
331	Donald Trump	Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama.	1
332	Donald Trump	They weren't even picked.	0
333	Donald Trump	They were picked by Obama.	0
334	Donald Trump	“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right.	0
335	Donald Trump	They were not politically correct when they drew this.	0
336	Donald Trump	In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it.	0
337	Donald Trump	He or she.	0
338	Donald Trump	I don't think the women care too much about that.	0
339	Donald Trump	Right?	0
340	Donald Trump	I don't think so.	0
341	Donald Trump	By the way, we did very well with women.	0
342	Donald Trump	You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls.	0
343	Donald Trump	When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women.	0
344	Donald Trump	We did very nicely with women.	0
345	Donald Trump	We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with.	0
346	Donald Trump	I guess we had to.	0
347	Donald Trump	That's why we're all here tonight.	0
348	Donald Trump	Right?	0
349	Donald Trump	So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country.	0
350	Donald Trump	Right?	0
351	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.	0
352	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.	0
353	Donald Trump	And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk.	0
354	Donald Trump	So unfair.	0
355	Donald Trump	So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days.	0
356	Donald Trump	We don't give up.	0
357	Donald Trump	We never give up.	0
358	Donald Trump	We had a court that I disagree with.	0
359	Donald Trump	I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand.	0
360	Donald Trump	They're saying how do you come up with that decision.	0
361	Donald Trump	It cannot be more simple.	0
362	Donald Trump	So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious.	0
363	Donald Trump	So we will do something next week.	0
364	Donald Trump	I think you'll be impressed.	0
365	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.	0
366	Donald Trump	Here's the bottom line.	0
367	Donald Trump	We've got to keep our country safe.	0
368	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening.	0
369	Donald Trump	We've got to keep our country safe.	0
370	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden.	0
371	Donald Trump	Sweden, who would believe this.	0
372	Donald Trump	Sweden.	0
373	Donald Trump	They took in large numbers.	0
374	Donald Trump	They're having problems like they never thought possible.	0
375	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening in Brussels.	0
376	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening all over the world.	0
377	Donald Trump	Take a look at Nice.	0
378	Donald Trump	Take a look at Paris.	0
379	Donald Trump	We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people.	1
380	Donald Trump	There was no documentation.	0
381	Donald Trump	There was no nothing.	0
382	Donald Trump	So we're going to keep our country safe.	0
383	Donald Trump	And we all have heart, by the way.	0
384	Donald Trump	And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones.	0
385	Donald Trump	We're going to have those safe zones.	0
386	Donald Trump	We do owe $20 trillion.	0
387	Donald Trump	Okay.	0
388	Donald Trump	So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones.	0
389	Donald Trump	They've got nothing, but money.	0
390	Donald Trump	We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers.	0
391	Donald Trump	Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people.	0
392	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us.	0
393	Donald Trump	We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country.	0
394	Donald Trump	We want people that are going to be great for our country.	0
395	Donald Trump	We don't want people with bad, bad ideas.	0
396	Donald Trump	We don't want that.	0
397	Donald Trump	I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS.	0
398	Donald Trump	I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military.	0
399	Donald Trump	We will pursue peace through strength.	0
400	Donald Trump	Our military is badly depleted.	0
401	Donald Trump	You have planes in the military.	0
402	Donald Trump	Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them.	0
403	Donald Trump	Their so old.	0
404	Donald Trump	We make the best equipment anywhere in the world.	0
405	Donald Trump	We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.	0
406	Donald Trump	And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home.	0
407	Donald Trump	We love our veterans.	0
408	Donald Trump	We're going to do a great job for our veterans.	0
409	Donald Trump	Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated.	0
410	Donald Trump	These are our great great people.	0
411	Donald Trump	We owe them so much.	0
412	Donald Trump	Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all.	0
413	Donald Trump	Our system and our country has led down our veterans.	0
414	Donald Trump	We are not going to let that go on any further.	0
415	Donald Trump	You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans.	0
416	Donald Trump	Thank you veterans.	0
417	Donald Trump	Who is here?	0
418	Donald Trump	Who is a veteran?	0
419	Donald Trump	We're going to take care of our veterans.	0
420	Donald Trump	We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable.	0
421	Donald Trump	We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.	0
422	Donald Trump	I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.	0
423	Donald Trump	And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people.	0
424	Donald Trump	I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia.	0
425	Donald Trump	His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.	0
426	Donald Trump	He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges.	0
427	Donald Trump	He's incredible and has an incredible resume.	0
428	Donald Trump	He's respected by all.	0
429	Donald Trump	His education is as good as it can get.	0
430	Donald Trump	His writings are truly amazing.	0
431	Donald Trump	He will be a true, true defender of our constitution.	0
432	Donald Trump	So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.	0
433	Donald Trump	No wonder they're doing so badly.	0
434	Donald Trump	You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency.	0
435	Donald Trump	That didn't happen.	0
436	Donald Trump	They were supposed to take over the Senate.	0
437	Donald Trump	That didn't happen.	0
438	Donald Trump	And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House.	0
439	Donald Trump	It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics.	0
440	Donald Trump	And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans.	0
441	Donald Trump	So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction.	0
442	Donald Trump	They got to get on with it.	0
443	Donald Trump	My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform.	0
444	Donald Trump	We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone.	0
445	Donald Trump	Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially.	0
446	Donald Trump	We're not going let that happen.	0
447	Donald Trump	Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy.	0
448	Donald Trump	It's a tragedy.	0
449	Donald Trump	You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%.	0
450	Donald Trump	Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it.	0
451	Donald Trump	Obamacare doesn't work.	0
452	Donald Trump	It's become totally unaffordable.	0
453	Donald Trump	Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable.	0
454	Donald Trump	It doesn't work.	0
455	Donald Trump	And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything.	0
456	Donald Trump	Sit back for two years, let it explode.	0
457	Donald Trump	The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people.	0
458	Donald Trump	We have to fix it.	0
459	Donald Trump	And we will.	0
460	Donald Trump	We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.	0
461	Donald Trump	You're all part of this incredible movement.	0
462	Donald Trump	This movement that we talk about so much.	0
463	Donald Trump	That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world.	0
464	Donald Trump	It's a movement that is just sweeping.	0
465	Donald Trump	It's sweeping across our country.	0
466	Donald Trump	It's sweeping frankly across the globe.	0
467	Donald Trump	Look at Brexit.	0
468	Donald Trump	Look at Brexit.	0
469	Donald Trump	Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at.	0
470	Donald Trump	People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.	0
471	Donald Trump	The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth.	0
472	Donald Trump	And now we have spirit like we've never had before.	0
473	Donald Trump	It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens.	0
474	Donald Trump	Erasing national borders does not make people safer.	0
475	Donald Trump	It undermines democracy and trade prosperity.	0
476	Donald Trump	We're giving it away.	0
477	Donald Trump	The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages.	0
478	Donald Trump	Really they are shrinking.	0
479	Donald Trump	18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs.	0
480	Donald Trump	Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away.	0
481	Donald Trump	We don't fight to win.	0
482	Donald Trump	We fight politically correct wars.	0
483	Donald Trump	We don't win anymore.	0
484	Donald Trump	We don't win at trade.	0
485	Donald Trump	We don't win in any capacity.	0
486	Donald Trump	We don't win anymore.	0
487	Donald Trump	We're going to start winning again.	0
488	Donald Trump	Believe me.	0
489	Donald Trump	And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages.	0
490	Donald Trump	This will be change for the ages.	0
491	Donald Trump	Change like never before.	0
492	Donald Trump	To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity.	0
493	Donald Trump	We want to secure our borders and protect our workers.	0
494	Donald Trump	To rebuild our military and our infrastructure.	0
495	Donald Trump	To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods.	0
496	Donald Trump	To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities.	0
497	Donald Trump	To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce.	0
498	Donald Trump	To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation.	0
499	Donald Trump	And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation.	0
500	Donald Trump	The tired echoes of yesterday's fights.	0
501	Donald Trump	We're fighting battles that no longer help us.	0
502	Donald Trump	We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.	0
503	Donald Trump	I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.	0
504	Donald Trump	They're not paying their bills.	0
505	Donald Trump	They're not paying their bills.	0
506	Donald Trump	They have to help us.	0
507	Donald Trump	No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past.	0
508	Donald Trump	No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure.	0
509	Donald Trump	New circumstances demand new solutions.	0
510	Donald Trump	Americans have fought and won wars together.	0
511	Donald Trump	Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives.	0
512	Donald Trump	Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next.	0
513	Donald Trump	Stretching back to the first day of our American independence.	0
514	Donald Trump	This is our legacy.	0
515	Donald Trump	It belongs to all of you.	0
516	Donald Trump	And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.	0
517	Donald Trump	Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts.	0
518	Donald Trump	Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.	0
519	Donald Trump	We are all brothers and all sisters.	0
520	Donald Trump	We share one home.	0
521	Donald Trump	One destiny and one glorious American flag.	0
522	Donald Trump	We are united together by history and by providence.	0
523	Donald Trump	We will make America strong again.	0
524	Donald Trump	I promise.	0
525	Donald Trump	We will make America proud again.	0
526	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.	0
527	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.	0
528	Donald Trump	Greater than ever before.	0
529	Donald Trump	May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America!	0
530	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
531	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
532	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
